  Suffolk Street Gallery, and I recollect accidentally

  were both &quot;touching up&quot; our productions. Joe Allen
  was the funny man of the society, and, though he
  startled me a little, he did not surprise me by a loud

  Punch.</p>
<p>&quot;Look out, my boy,&quot; he said to his friend, &quot;for
  the first number. We&quot; (I suppose he was a member
  of the first staff) &quot;shall take the town by storm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> There is no mistake about it. We have so-and-so&quot;&mdash;naming
  some well-known men&mdash;&quot;for writers;
  Hine, Kenny Meadows, young Leech, and a lot
  more first-rate illustrators,&quot; etc.</p>
<p>Whether Allen's friend took his advice and bought
  the first number of <i>Punch</i>, which appeared in the
  following July, I know not; but I bought a copy,
  and remember my disappointment at finding
  Leech conspicuous by his absence from the pages.
  In the hope of finding him in the second issue, I
  went to the shop where I had bought the first. The
  shopman met my request for the second number
  of <i>Punch</i>, as well as I can recollect, in the following
  words:</p>
<p>&quot;What paper, sir? Oh, <i>Punch</i>! Yes, I took a
  few of the first; but it's no go. You see, they billed
  it about a good deal&quot; (how well I recollect that
  expression!), &quot;so I wanted to see what it was like.
  It won't do; it's no go.&quot;</p>
<p>I have been told that, like most newspapers, <i>Punch</i> had some difficulty in keeping upon his legs
  in his first efforts to move; but as those elegant
  members, so exquisitely drawn by Tenniel, have
  supported the famous hunchback for nearly half a
  century, there is no need for his friends' anxiety
  as to his future movements.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>
<p>Though Leech had engaged himself to the then
  proprietors of <i>Punch</i> as one of the illustrators of the
  paper, it seems strange that his first contribution did
  not appear till the 7th of August, and in the fourth
  number, and stranger still that its appearance should
  have damaged the paper. Under the heading of
  &quot;Foreign Affairs,&quot; the artist represents groups of
  foreigners such as may be seen any day in the
  neighbourhood of Leicester Square. The reader is
  told in a footnote that the plate does not represent
  foreign <i>gentlemen</i>, an unnecessary intimation to anyone
  who knows a foreign gentleman.</p>
<p>It is said that this engraving sent down the circulation
  of <i>Punch</i> to an alarming point. I confess my
  inability to understand this, and would rather
  attribute the decadence to some other cause, contemporary
  with the production of &quot;Foreign Affairs.&quot;
  The drawing is somewhat hard upon the foreign
  frequenters of the purlieus of Leicester Square, and
  would only have been more acceptable to John Bull
  on that account. By Leech's non-appearance in <i>Punch</i> for many months after &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;
  was published, one is driven to the conclusion that
  the managers had little faith in him as an attraction.
  The second volume contains very few of Leech's
  designs, while it bristles with inferior work.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>
<p>My own admiration for Leech's genius, so constantly
  roused by his works, with which I was
  familiar, created a great desire for his acquaintance;
  but being perfectly unknown at that time as an
  artist, and knowing none of Leech's friends, I began
  to despair of the realization of my wishes, when
  accident helped me.</p>
<p>A Scottish painter&mdash;a Highlander and fierce
  Jacobite&mdash;named McIan, who was also an actor
  and friend of Macready, to whose theatrical company
  he was attached, lived with his wife, an accomplished
  artist, somewhere in the neighbourhood of
  Gordon Square. Calling one morning to see Mrs.
  McIan, I found her in her studio, not, as usual, hard
  at work at her own easel, but superintending the
  labours of a pupil, who was hard at work at another;
  and the pupil, a tall, slim, and remarkably handsome
  young man, was John Leech.</p>
<p>I made some remark about the different method
  in which he was employed to that with which he
  was familiar. I forget what he was copying&mdash;some
  still life, I think.</p>
<p>&quot;I like painting much better than what I have to
  grind at day after day, if I could only do it,&quot; said
  Leech; &quot;but it's so confoundedly difficult, you
  know, and requires such a lot of patience.&quot;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>
<p>I fancy I thought his efforts in oil-painting on that
  occasion very promising; but the exigencies of his
  position quite prevented the unceasing devotion to
  the study of painting which is required before any
  success can be assured.</p>
<p>Leech was once heard to say that he would rather
  be the painter of a really good picture than the producer
  of any number of the &quot;kind of things&quot; he did.
  I, for one, am very thankful that he never did produce
  a good picture, for he would have been tempted
  to repeat the success, to the loss of numbers of delightful
  sketches.</p>
<p>Mrs. McIan appeared to think that Leech would
  soon cease to draw for <i>Punch</i>; indeed, she doubted,
  as did many others, that <i>Punch</i> would long succeed
  in attracting the public; and I joined her in the
  hope&mdash;rather hypocritically, I fear&mdash;that her young
  friend would persevere in mastering the difficulty of
  the technicalities of oil-painting, and thus place himself
  amongst the best painters of the country. Leech
  had taken many lessons from Mrs. McIan, and that
  lady seemed convinced that he had but to persevere
  and the difficulties would fall before him, as, to use
  her own figure, the walls of Jericho fell before the
  sound of the trumpet. Ah, perseverance! &quot;there's
  the rub.&quot;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>
<p>From the time of my introduction to Leech I
  became gradually very intimate with him, and the
  more I knew of his nature, the more I became convinced
  that he totally lacked the disposition for continuous,
  steady, mechanical industry necessary for
  success in painting. He constantly ridiculed the
  care spent on the details in pictures; finish, in his
  opinion, was so much waste of time. &quot;When you
  can see what a man intends to convey in his picture,
  you have got all he wants, and all you ought to wish
  for; all elaboration of an idea after the idea is comprehensible
  is so much waste of time&quot;&mdash;this was his
  constant cry, a little contradicted by the fact that he
  as constantly tried to paint his ideas, but in a fitful
  and perfunctory manner.</p>
<p>I can imagine the enthusiasm that was lighted up
  in Leech upon his first sight of one of our annual
  exhibitions. After a visit to one of them he was
  known to have gone home, and getting out easel,
  canvas, and colours, he would set to work in a fury
  of enthusiasm, which evaporated at the encounter of
  the first technical difficulty. He used to take
  pleasure in watching my own attempts at painting,
  and I remember on one occasion, when I was
  finishing a rather elaborate piece of work, he
  said:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<p>&quot;Ah, my Frith, I wasn't created to do that sort
  of thing! I should never have patience for it.&quot;</p>
<p>He was right, and, happily for the world, he
  became convinced that, even if he had the power to
  fully &quot;carry out&quot;&mdash;as we call it&mdash;one of his drawings
  into a completed oil picture, the time required would
  have deprived us of immortal sketches; and though
  he undoubtedly &quot;left off where difficulties begin&quot;&mdash;as
  I once heard a painter, who was exasperated at
  Leech's sneers at his manipulation, say to him&mdash;he
  has left behind him work which will continue
  to delight succeeding generations so long as wit,
  humour, character and beauty are appreciated&mdash;that
  is to say, so long as human nature endures.</p>
<p>I feel I ought to apologize for what I am about to
  tell, because it has nothing to do with my hero beyond
  the fact of its occurrence having taken place on the
  memorable morning when I first had the happiness
  of meeting him.</p>
<p>I have said that McIan was a Scotchman, a Highlander
  of the clan McIan, and a worshipper of
  Charles Stuart, whose usual cognomen, the Pretender,
  I should have been sorry to have used in
  the presence of my Jacobite friend. As Leech left
  the room to go to his &quot;grind,&quot; as he called his woodwork,
  McIan entered, and we were discussing Leech's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> prospects when McIan's servant&mdash;an old, hard-featured
  Scotchwoman&mdash;hurried into the room, and,
  in an awe-stricken voice, said:</p>
<p>&quot;Sir&mdash;sir, here's the Preences!&quot;</p>
<p>The words were scarcely out of her mouth, when
  two gentlemen entered&mdash;tall, rather distinguished
  but melancholy, looking young men. No sooner did
  McIan and his wife catch sight of them, than, without
  a word, they both dropped upon their knees, and
  while the lady kissed the hands of one of the gentlemen,
  her husband paid a similar attention to the
  hands of the other. I was holding my hat, and I
  remember I dropped it in my astonishment, for I
  was not aware that I was in the presence of the last
  of the Stuarts; or that these two young men claimed
  to be the great-grandsons of the hero of Culloden,
  and amongst a large section of Scotchmen, and not
  a few Englishmen, had their claim allowed. Anyone
  curious about this delusion can read for himself how
  it was dispelled, but the men themselves implicitly
  believed in their royal descent. They are both dead
  now. I once saw one of them again at a garden-party
  at Chelsea Hospital, where his likeness to the
  Stuarts was the talk of the company. It was certainly
  striking.</p>
<p>It is a melancholy task to me to try to recall the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> social scenes in which Leech so often figured&mdash;sad
  indeed to think how few of his friends, more intimate
  with him than I, now remain amongst us!
  Though Leech very seldom illustrated any ideas but
  his own, I can recall an example or two to the contrary;
  and still oftener have I seen, by the sparkle
  of his eye, that something occurring in conversation
  had suggested a &quot;cut.&quot;</p>
<p>I think it was Dickens who said that a big
  cock-pheasant rising in covert under one's nose was
  like a firework let off in that locality. Elsewhere
  we have Leech's rendering of the idea.</p>
<p>When cards, or some other way of getting rid
  of time after dinner, had been proposed, I have
  heard Leech say:</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, bother cards! Let us have conversation.&quot;</p>
<p>And talk it was, often good talk; but Leech was
  more a listener than a partaker. Not that he could
  not talk, and admirably; but he was always on the
  watch for subjects which he hoped something in
  conversation might suggest.</p>
<p>Leech's mental condition was certainly deeply
  tinged with the sadness so common to men who
  possess wit and humour to a high degree. He
  sang well, but his songs were all of a melancholy
  character, and very difficult to get from him. Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> the only one I can remember, and that but
  partially, was something about &quot;King Death,&quot; with
  allusions to a beverage called &quot;coal-black wine,&quot;
  which that potentate was supposed to drink. As I
  write I can see the dear fellow's melancholy face,
  with his eyes cast up to the ceiling, where Dickens
  said the song was written in ghostly characters
  which none but Leech could read.</p>
<p>I may give another example&mdash;rare, no doubt&mdash;of
  Leech's having used a suggested subject. Many
  years ago my brother-in-law, long since dead, took
  a party of friends to the Derby. They drove, or,
  rather, were driven, down to Epsom, the usual post-boy
  being recommended as a careful, steady driver&mdash;a
  character very desirable, considering the crowded
  state of the road, more especially on the return
  journey. The post-boy quite realized all that was
  said of him as the party went to the course, but
  when the time came for departure he was found,
  after considerable searching, to be as nearly dead-drunk
  as possible. What was to be done? The
  man could scarcely stand; his driving was, of course,
  out of the question.</p>

<img src="images/i_022.jpg" width="600" height="403" alt="" /> <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Drunken Post-boy.</span></span></div>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said my brother-in-law to his friends, &quot;if
  you will trust yourselves to me, I will ride and drive
  you back;&quot; and, after tying the post-boy on to the<span class="pagenum"> <a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> carriage, where he soon fell fast asleep, my brother
  mounted and drove his party safely home.</p>
<p>This I thought a good subject for Leech, and
  I suggested it to him. He smiled faintly, and said
  not a word. Very nearly a year after I had told
  him of the incident, as I was walking with him one
  day, he said:</p>
<p>&quot;By the way, Frith, are you going to use the
  subject you mentioned to me of the drunken post-boy
  and your brother-in-law?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I? No,&quot; said I; &quot;it's more in your way than
  mine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then I'll do it next week.&quot;</p>
<p>He was as good as his word.</p>
<p>Nothing could be less like my brother-in-law than
  the delightful &quot;swell&quot; who is driving home some
  charming women, who are, however, left to our
  imagination; and as to the post-boy, the artist has
  awoke him to some purpose. What could surpass
  that drunken smile?</p>

<p>Long, long ago there might have been seen on
  the sands at Ramsgate two stuffed figures, the size
  of life, intended to represent soldiers; for they were
  bedecked with the red coat, cap, and trousers of the
  ordinary private. The clothes were simply stuffed
  out into something resembling human forms, but the<span class="pagenum"> <a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> effect, as may be supposed, was ludicrous in the
  extreme. They were the work of a professor of
  archery, who supplied his customers with bows and
  arrows, with which the archer showed how seldom
  he could hit the target made by the two soldiers.
  Leech and I watched the shooting for some time,
  till the little sketch-book was produced, and Leech
  made a rapid drawing of the two soldiers, afterwards
  to figure in an inimitable cut in <i>Punch</i>.</p>
<p>A young lady is seen bathing with her aunt, whose
  attention she is directing to the two stuffed figures.
  The aunt is short-sighted, and the girl is wickedly
  pretending that the figures are live officers, watching
  the bathers. The aunt says, &quot;They may be officers,
  but they are not gentlemen,&quot; etc.</p>
<p>I am sure that Leech never used a model, in the
  sense that the model is commonly used by artists,
  for the thousands of human beings made immortal
  by his genius; but that he made numberless sketches
  for backgrounds, detail of dresses, landscapes, foregrounds,
  and bits of character caught from unconscious
  sitters, there can be no doubt. How
  wonderful was the memory, how sensitive the
  mental organization, that could retain and reproduce
  every variety of type, every variety of beauty and
  character!</p>

<h3>CARTOONS.</h3>
<p>As I fancy I am one of the few of Leech's friends
  who have figured personally in <i>Punch</i>, I may be
  excused for the egotism of the following:</p>
<p>About the year 1852 I began the first of a series
  of pictures from modern life, then quite a novelty in
  the hands of anyone who could paint tolerably. When
  the picture which was called &quot;Many Happy Returns
  of the Day&quot; (a birthday subject, in which the health
  of the little heroine of the day is being drunk)
  was finished, Leech came to see it, and expressed
  his satisfaction on finding an artist who could leave
  what he called &quot;mouldy costumes&quot; for the habits
  and manners of everyday life. As he was speaking,
  two of my brother artists, whose practice was on
  different lines to mine, called, and saw my picture
  for the first time. They both looked attentively at
  it, and the longer they looked&mdash;judging from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> faces&mdash;the less they liked it. I shall not forget
  Leech's expression when I gave him a sort of questioning
  look as to the correctness of his judgment.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, what do you think of the picture?&quot; said
  Leech to one of the painters.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, really I don't know what to think,&quot; was
  the reply.</p>
<p>It never occurred to me that the incident was one
  likely to serve my friend for a drawing; lively was
  my surprise, and great was my pleasure, therefore,
  when I saw myself &quot;immortalized for ever,&quot; as my
  old master used to say, in the pages of <i>Punch</i>.</p>
<p>In this drawing may be seen a striking proof of
  the avoidance of personality which always distinguished
  Leech. I cannot see my own back, but I
  have been assured by those who have had that
  privilege that there is a dashing, not to say aristocratic,
  character about Jack Armstrong to which I
  have no claim. While Messrs. Potter and Feeble
  are quite curiously unlike the persons they are supposed
  to represent&mdash;neither of my high art friends
  wore beards&mdash;yet the attitudes of the men were
  exactly reproduced; while the background, with
  armour, oak-cabinet, etc., for which no sketch was
  taken, was a perfectly correct representation of my
  old painting-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>
<p>In one of my autumnal holidays Leech stayed a
  few days with me. He had not been well; picking
  up &quot;a thousand stones in a thousand hours,&quot; to
  which he likened his unceasing work, had begun to
  tell upon him; and in reply to my warning, that, for
  his own sake, to say nothing of the interests of <i>Punch</i>, he should husband his strength&mdash;for, I added,
  &quot;If anything happened to you, who are 'the backbone
  of <i>Punch</i>,' what would become of the paper?&quot;&mdash;I
  can see his smile as I hear him say, &quot;Don't talk
  such rubbish! backbone of <i>Punch</i>, indeed! Why,
  bless your heart! there isn't a fellow at work upon the
  paper that doesn't think <i>that</i> of himself, and with
  about as much right and reason as I should. <i>Punch</i> would get on well enough without me, or any of
  those who think themselves of such importance.&quot;</p>
<p>Among the many admirable qualities that adorned
  the character of John Leech his modesty was remarkable;
  he thought little or nothing of his own
  work. &quot;Talk of drawing, my dear fellow,&quot; he once
  said to me, &quot;what is my drawing compared to
  Tenniel's? Look at the way that chap can draw a
  boot; why, I couldn't do it to save my life.&quot;</p>
<p>Though Leech in his modesty chose to ignore the
  fact, it was no less a fact that for nearly a quarter
  of a century he was the leading spirit of <i>Punch</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> &quot;Think,&quot; said Thackeray, &quot;what a number of <i>Punch</i> would be without a drawing by Leech in
  it!&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to the wonderful political cartoons,
  Leech contributed more than three thousand illustrations
  of life and manners to the paper; and it is
  said&mdash;I know not how truly&mdash;that he received from
  first to last more than &pound;40,000 for his contributions
  to <i>Punch</i> alone. If he did, what did he do with the
  money? That he was in no way extravagant I
  know, and that he was frequently in dire straits after
  his connection with <i>Punch</i> I also know. Let my
  reader imagine what pecuniary trouble must have
  been to this man, whose mind was racked by the
  constantly recurring demands for intellectual work
  such as Leech supplied week after week, and often
  day after day! Did he lend or give away his hardly-earned
  money? Did he accept bills for so-called
  friends, and find that he had to meet them? Leech
  was one of the most open-hearted and generous of
  men, an easy victim to a plausible tale of real or
  fictitious distress. I suppose we shall never know
  why a man who made so large an income, who had
  not a large family to absorb much of it, and who
  never lived expensively, should have died comparatively
  poor. Let me leave these painful considerations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> and &quot;pursue the triumph and partake the
  gale&quot; of the artist's glorious career.</p>
<p>Between Cruikshank and Leech there existed
  little sympathy and less intimacy. The extravagant
  caricature that pervades so much of Cruikshank's
  work, and from which Leech was entirely free,
  blinded him a little to the great merit of Cruikshank's
  serious work. I was very intimate with
  &quot;Immortal George,&quot; as he was familiarly called, and
  I was much surprised by the coolness with which he
  received my enthusiastic praise of Leech.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; said George, &quot;very clever. The new
  school, you see. Public always taken with novelty.&quot;</p>
<p>For the larger part of fifty-seven years Cruikshank
  told me he had been in the habit of drinking
  wine and spirits, often a great deal too much of
  both; but from his fifty-seventh birthday to his
  seventy-fifth, when he lectured me for taking a
  single glass of sherry, he had devoted himself to
  strict teetotalism, the interests of which he advocated
  by tongue, brush, and etching-needle.</p>
<p>Unlike Leech, Cruikshank was a painter, and the
  last years of his life were spent in painting a huge
  picture, or, rather, a series of pictures upon one
  canvas, which he called &quot;The Worship of Bacchus.&quot;
  From this work he executed a large engraving, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> proof of which he presented to me, telling me to
  study it well and I should see what dire results
  might arise from drinking a glass of sherry. Like
  most proselytes, Cruikshank carried his faith in his
  creed to the verge of absurdity, and sometimes beyond
  it; but in the &quot;Worship of Bacchus,&quot; and
  more powerfully still in a series of etchings called
  &quot;The Bottle,&quot; he gave his tragic power full play,
  and produced scenes and incidents in which the consequences
  of &quot;drink&quot; are portrayed&mdash;now with
  pathos, now with the terrible retribution that often
  ends the drunkard's career in madness.</p>
<p>In one of the large cartoons in <i>Punch</i> Leech used
  the awful figure of &quot;Fagin in the Condemned Cell&quot;
  (one of Cruikshank's finest illustrations to &quot;Oliver
  Twist&quot;), changing him into King Louis Philippe.
  That sovereign was always somewhat of a red rag
  to Leech, as many cuts, in which the king is turned
  into ridicule, prove; and when the crash of 1848
  came, Leech received the fugitive with a shower of
  drawings, culminating in the tragic figure exiled and
  in the condemned cell. The student of Leech does
  not require to be told that the artist was as great in
  the tragedies of life as he was when he shot the
  follies as they flew about him, or when he touched so
  caressingly the beauty of childhood and of women.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>
<p>During the Crimean War, when such fearful news
  came to us of the sufferings of our soldiers during
  the inclement winter of 1854-55, the Emperor of
  Russia is said to have invoked the aid of Generals
  January and February in our ruin. Those officers
  certainly destroyed many of our men, but one of
  them laid his icy hand upon the man who had called
  him for so different a purpose. Never can I forget
  the impression that Leech's drawing of the Emperor's
  death-bed made upon me! There lay the Czar, a
  noble figure in death, as he was in life, and by his
  side a stronger King than he&mdash;a bony figure, in
  General's uniform, snow-besprinkled, who &quot;beckons
  him away.&quot; Of all Leech's serious work, this seems
  to me the finest example. Think how savage
  Gillray or vulgar Rowlandson would have handled
  such a theme!&mdash;the Emperor would have been caricatured
  into a repulsive monster, and Death would
  have lost his terrors. Moreover, neither of those
  artists was capable of conceiving the subject.</p>
<p>To show the infinite variety of Leech's powers, I
  may draw attention in this place to another of the
  political cartoons.</p>
<p>The uneasiness created in this country by what
  was called the &quot;Papal Aggression&quot; always seemed to
  me as absurd and unfounded as it has since proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> to have been. I remember asking Cardinal Manning,
  then Archbishop of Westminster by order of
  the Pope, for his autograph. He wrote his name
  for me, but when I asked him to add his title, he
  smiled and said, &quot;I dare not do that; I might be
  sent to prison if I wrote my Popish title.&quot;</p>
<p>Lord John Russell was in power at that time, and
  was of course very active in the crusade against the
  Catholics. The Cardinal in England was Wiseman;
  and Leech drew Lord John as a street boy, running
  away from the Cardinal's door, after chalking &quot;No
  Popery&quot; upon it. Perfect in workmanship, and
  perfect in idea, is this admirable drawing.</p>
<p>I may note here one very bad consequence of
  the &quot;Papal Aggression&quot;&mdash;namely, the secession of
  Richard Doyle from the <i>Punch</i> staff. Doyle was a
  Catholic; it was therefore impossible for him to
  remain amongst men who, by pen and pencil,
  opposed what was called the audacious attempt to
  &quot;tithe and toll in our dominions.&quot; It was a pity,
  for Doyle was, next to Leech, by far the strongest
  man on the staff of <i>Punch</i> artists&mdash;quaintly
  humorous, and full of a delicate fancy, but without
  the broad views of life or the grasp of character that
  distinguished Leech. Of course, as personality was
  the essence of the political cartoons, the use of it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> unavoidable; but Leech managed to be personal
  without being offensive to the chief actor, unless, as
  in the case of Louis Philippe and a few others, he
  considered that their escapades deserved severe
  castigation; he then took good care to apply the
  whip with a will. Lord Russell, in his &quot;Recollections,&quot;
  speaks of the &quot;No Popery&quot; satire as &quot;a fair
  hit.&quot;</p>
<p>In many of the political cartoons official personages
  are represented as boys, well-behaved or ill-behaved,
  obstinate or stupid, or both, in the work appointed
  for them. For example, when Sir Robert Peel
  resigned, in 1846, Lord John Russell figures as
  page-boy applying for the vacant place. The
  Queen looks the button boy up and down, and then
  says, &quot;I fear, John, you are not strong enough for
  the situation.&quot;</p>
<p>Then we have Disraeli, also as a boy, in whose
  figure that statesman's curious foppery in dress is
  felicitously noted, confronted with a majestic figure
  of Sir Robert Peel, who says:</p>
<p>&quot;Well, my little man, what are you going to do
  this Session, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why&mdash;aw&mdash;aw&mdash;I've made arrangements&mdash;aw&mdash;to
  smash everything.&quot;</p>
<p>Events of the past, looked at by the light of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> present, assume sometimes very strange, almost
  incredible aspects. Can there have been a time, one
  is inclined to ask, when a man's religion could prove
  a bar to college, Bench, and Parliament? Assuredly
  there was such a time, and not long ago&mdash;say forty
  years or so&mdash;when no Jew could be a judge or a
  member of Parliament; and it was only after severe
  battles and many defeats that victory at last attended
  the Jewish banner. One of the most violent opponents
  of the Jews was Sir Robert Harry Inglis, a
  very conscientious and worthy gentleman. By a
  happy thought of Leech's, Sir Robert is made to
  figure in one of the most humorous of the political
  cartoons.</p>
<p>About this time my old friend Frank Stone had
  painted two pictures in illustration of his favourite
  theme&mdash;love. They were called &quot;The First Appeal&quot;
  and &quot;The Last Appeal.&quot; In the first a kind of
  peasant lover is beseeching his &quot;flame&quot; to listen to
  his vows. She listens, but without encouraging a
  hope in the swain that he will prevail. Time is
  supposed to pass, leaving terrible traces of suffering&mdash;apparently
  to the verge of consumption&mdash;in the
  young man, who, on finding the girl at a well, makes
  his last, almost dying, appeal. He seizes her hand;
  but she turns away, deaf to his passionate beseeching.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<p>In the Leech drawing the composition of Stone's
  picture is exactly preserved; but in place of the lady
  we have Sir Robert Inglis, who turns away in horror
  from a young gentleman of a very marked Jewish
  type indeed.</p>
<p>The present <i>Punch</i> artists have greatly the advantage
  of Leech, in respect of the aid derivable from
  photography. In these days, there is scarcely a
  statesman whose photograph cannot be seen in
  the London shop-windows, to the great advantage
  of the political caricaturists of to-day. It was only
  at the latter part of Leech's time that photography
  became so generally used to familiarize us with the
  features of our legislators, and even then I doubt if
  Leech took much advantage of it. He had seen all
  these men, and a rough sketch in his note-book,
  aided by his marvellous memory, was sufficient to
  enable him to produce unmistakable likenesses.</p>
<p>It remains for me to note some of the instances in
  which Leech's powers were brought to bear upon
  the social questions of the time&mdash;questions admitting
  of a humorous or a pathetic treatment, apart from
  those of a merely political character.</p>
<p>In 1850 a motion by Lord Ashley, afterwards
  Shaftesbury, was carried against the Government by
  a majority of ninety-three to sixty-eight, ordering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> that the transmission and delivery of letters on
  Sunday should cease in all parts of the kingdom.
  The new law was acted upon for some weeks, and
  caused so much public inconvenience, and so great
  and indignant a popular outcry, that the obnoxious
  rules were rescinded. Leech took full advantage of
  the opportunity thus afforded him. His ready
  imagination supplied him with instances in which
  the operation of the new law would cause loss and
  suffering. This was shown in a drawing which,
  amongst other proofs, depicts a mother in great
  distress because she can have no news of her
  sick child. And when, in September, 1850, the
  obnoxious regulation was withdrawn, Leech celebrated
  the event in an admirable cartoon, in which
  the promoters, Lords Russell and Ashley, dressed
  as Puritans, are ruefully contemplating each other,
  Russell addressing his fellow-Puritan with, &quot;Verily,
  Brother Ashley, between you and me and the <i>post</i> we have made a nice mess of it!&quot;</p>
<p>The neglect of our troops during the Crimean
  campaign afforded the artist many humorous and
  tragic subjects. The Government was accused,
  rightly or wrongly, of many sins of omission and
  commission; amongst the rest, of not providing the
  army with clothing suitable to the terrible winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> which it was sure to have to pass in front of Sebastopol.
  And one of Leech's most telling drawings
  represents two ragged soldiers shivering in the snow.
  One tells the other that news has arrived of a medal
  that is to be awarded. &quot;Yes,&quot; says his comrade;
  &quot;but they had much better send us a coat to put
  it on.&quot;</p>
<p>Two pictures may be noted&mdash;one by Tenniel,
  which is infinitely pathetic, the other by Leech,
  ghastly in its contrast to the humorous side of the
  author's powers. The first represents a fashionable
  lady, whose magnificent ball-dress has just been
  fitted upon her by the dressmaker, who says:</p>
<p>&quot;We would not have disappointed your ladyship
  at any <i>sacrifice</i>, and the robe is finished <span class="smcap">&Agrave; MERVEILLE</span>.&quot;</p>
<p>But the <i>sacrifice</i>! The lady turns to the looking-glass,
  wherein she sees the dress, and part of
  the cost of making it, in the appalling figure of
  the workwoman, whose haggard form leans back
  exhausted, dully lighted by a dying lamp, by the
  help of which all night long the lady has not been
  &quot;<i>disappointed</i>.&quot;</p>

<img src="images/i_040.jpg" width="600" height="356" alt="" /> <span class="caption">&quot;<span class="smcap">The Jew and Skeleton Tailors.</span>&quot;</span> </div>
<p>The sufferings of the workers, through which
  their employers so often became rich, touched the
  tender heart of Leech, and he never lost an opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
of pointing out the selfish tyranny of both the
  men and women traders who almost ground the life
  out of their unhappy assistants.</p>
<p>If John Leech could have entertained a prejudice
  against any human beings, it must have been against
  the Jewish race, for there is scarcely an instance in
  which he deals with the Jews that they do not suffer
  under his hand. The points of their physiognomy
  are rather cruelly prominent sometimes, even almost
  to caricature, and they are constantly placed in
  ludicrous positions. There can be no doubt that in
  some instances the tailor is no less a bloodsucker
  than the dressmaker, but I think there are as many,
  or more, Christian&mdash;or, rather, unchristian&mdash;tailors
  who &quot;sweat&quot; their workpeople as there are Jewish.
  However, in one of Leech's most powerful prints,
  he gives the <i>pas</i> to the Jew, who watches a group of
  skeleton tailors as they labour in their bones for his
  benefit. It is a gruesome drawing, which, once
  seen, can never be forgotten.</p>
<p>Leech was happily left to his own devices as
  regards the contributions to <i>Punch</i>, with the sole
  exception of the large cartoons, the subjects of which
  were always settled by the whole staff at a dinner,
  which took place every Wednesday. At this dinner
  no strangers were present. This was, and is still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> the rule. Exceptions, however, were made on one
  or two occasions in favour of Charles Dickens, Sir
  Joseph Paxton, and some others.</p>
<p>It was, of course, open to any member to
  suggest a subject, and in the early Leech days
  it is said that the discussions on a proposed theme
  waxed fast and furious, Thackeray and Douglas
  Jerrold generally taking opposite sides. The
  dinners were usually held in the front room of
  the first-floor of No. 11, Bouverie Street&mdash;the business-place
  of the proprietors of the paper&mdash;and the
  Bedford Hotel, Covent Garden, was sometimes
  honoured by the presence of the staff. During the
  summer months the dinners took place at Greenwich,
  Richmond, or Blackwall; and once a year
  there was a more comprehensive banquet, at which
  compositors, readers, printers, clerks, etc., assisted.
  This dinner was called the &quot;Way-goose.&quot; I am
  speaking of long ago. Whether these details would
  apply to the present time I know not.</p>
<p>I never knew Jerrold. I have frequently seen
  him, but always avoided an introduction; for, to
  speak the truth, I was afraid of him. I had heard
  so many stories of his making &quot;dead sets&quot; at new
  acquaintances as to disincline me to become one.
  By anybody quick at repartee I was told he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> easily silenced, and an example was mentioned when
  a barmaid succeeded in stopping a torrent of &quot;chaff&quot;
  of which she was the victim. It appears that Jerrold
  went with some friends to a supper-room one night
  after the theatre. The supper was &quot;topped up&quot;
  with hot grog, which was served to the guests in
  large, old-fashioned rummers.</p>
<p>&quot;There,&quot; said the girl, as she placed the big glass
  before Jerrold, &quot;there's your grog, and mind you
  don't fall into it.&quot;</p>
<p>Jerrold was a very little man, and the hit told
  to the extent of dulling him for the rest of the
  evening.</p>
<p>At the Wednesday dinner the whole of the contents
  of the forthcoming number of <i>Punch</i> were
  discussed. When the cloth was removed and
  dessert laid upon the table, the first question put by
  the editor was:</p>
<p>&quot;What shall the cartoon be?&quot;</p>
<p>It is said of Tenniel that he rarely suggested a
  subject for the cartoon, but that the readiness with
  which he saw and explained the possibilities of a
  subject was remarkable. During the Indian Mutiny,
  Shirley Brooks proposed that the picture should
  represent the British Lion in the act of springing
  upon the native soldiers in revenge for the cruelties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> at Cawnpore. Tenniel rose to the occasion, and, as
  Brooks told me, he exclaimed, &quot;By Jove, that will
  do for a double-page cut!&quot; and a magnificent double-page
  drawing was made of it by him.</p>
<p>In the inevitable difference of opinion that arose
  on the occasion of these dinners&mdash;the chief disputants
  being, as I have just observed, Thackeray
  and Jerrold&mdash;Jerrold, being the oldest as well as the
  noisiest, generally came off victorious. In these
  rows it is said to have required all the suavity of
  Mark Lemon to calm the storm, his award always
  being final. Jerrold used to say:</p>
<p>&quot;It's no use our quarrelling, for we must meet
  again and shake hands next Wednesday.&quot;</p>
<p>The last editions of the evening papers were always
  brought in, so that the cartoon might apply to the
  latest date. On the Thursday morning following
  the editor called at the houses of the artists to see
  what was being done. On Friday night all copy
  was delivered and put into type, and at two
  o'clock on Saturday proofs were revised, the
  forms made up, and with the last movement of
  the engine the whole of the type was placed
  under the press, which could not be moved till
  the Monday morning.</p>
<p>By means of the Wednesday meetings, the discussions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> arising on all questions helped both caricaturist
  and wit to take a broad view of things, as well
  as enabled the editor to get his team to draw well
  together and give uniformity of tone to all the contributions.</p>

<h3>THE LAWYER'S STORY.</h3>
<p>By the courtesy of the proprietors of <i>Punch</i>, I am
  allowed to reproduce in this place a delightfully
  humorous drawing, the scene of which is laid in
  a barber's shop.</p>
<p>This picture explains itself, but there is a circumstance
  connected with it which is, I think, well worth
  relating; and as I heard it from Leech's own lips at
  one of the pleasant Egg dinners, I will give it in
  Leech's own words, the strangeness of the incident
  having left a very vivid impression on my memory.
  The usual company&mdash;Dickens, Forster, Lemon, etc.&mdash;was
  present; Leech was singing. We had
  listened for some time to the inevitable &quot;King
  Death,&quot; when Dickens exclaimed:</p>
<p>&quot;There, that will do; if you go on any longer,
  you will make me cry. Tell them about the lawyer
  who lost his client. Yes, I know the story, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> they don't; and I would much rather hear it again
  than listen to any more of that lugubrious song.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, here goes,&quot; said Leech. &quot;I suppose there
  is no one at this table who neglects to improve his
  mind by the weekly study of <i>Punch</i>; at any rate, all
  civilized people are familiar with the illustrations
  which adorn that famous periodical. Amongst those
  classical works the other day was a high-art drawing
  by me, representing a gentleman in a barber's shop,
  having his hair cut. In the course of talk peculiar
  to his fraternity, the little hairdresser remarks that
  his customer's hair <i>is very thin on the top</i>. This
  mild observation moved the object of it, a person
  of irascible temper, into ungovernable fury. He
  springs from his chair, which he upsets in the action,
  and flying at the terrified barber, he exclaims, 'Confound
  you, you puppy! Do you think I came here
  to be insulted and told of my imperfections? <i>I'll
  thin your top!</i>'</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>
<img src="images/i_048.jpg" width="600" height="409" alt="" /> <span class="caption">&quot;<span class="smcap">I&#39;ll Thin Your Top.</span>&quot;</span> </div>
<p>&quot;Well, I don't see anything particularly facetious in
  the drawing, but a friend of mine, a lawyer in Bedford
  Row, did, and laughed whenever he thought of it.
  Unfortunately, the day on which the drawing was
  published had been fixed for a consultation upon
  a matter in which an old and respected client's
  interests were seriously involved. Legal points of<span class="pagenum"> <a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> extreme intricacy and difficulty were to be examined
  and discussed; hopes were to be encouraged, and
  anxiety appeased. In his information to his legal
  adviser, the client had arrived at a point of extreme
  gravity, when my unfortunate drawing obtruded itself
  upon the legal mind, and so disturbed it as to cause
  the lawyer to repress a laugh with much difficulty.</p>
<p>&quot;'I see you smile,' said the client. 'Surely the
  very serious character of the evidence which I put
  before you should strike you as convin&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>&quot;'Oh, I beg your pardon; I was not smiling.'</p>
<p>&quot;'Well, you did something very like it. I really
  must ask for your strictest attention to facts which
  are capable of such absolute&mdash;&mdash; There you go
  again! My dear sir, what <i>can</i> there be in my statement
  to cause a smile? Pray think of the gravity of
  the case&mdash;how deeply my interests are at stake&mdash;and
  give me your most serious attention.'</p>
<p>&quot;'I will&mdash;indeed I will,' said the lawyer, mentally
  devoting me and my drawing to the devil.</p>
<p>&quot;For some minutes the legal gentleman succeeded
  in banishing the little barber and his enraged victim;
  but suddenly they again ruthlessly seized upon his
  imagination, and he laughed aloud.</p>
<p>&quot;'Good God!' said the client; 'what is there to
  laugh at in that?'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>
<p>&quot;'I assure you, sir, I was not laughing at what
  you told me, which is important indeed, but at a
  ludicrous idea that crossed my mind.'</p>
<p>&quot;'What business have ludicrous ideas in your
  mind when you require all its attention for business
  which&mdash;excuse my saying so&mdash;you are well paid for
  listening to?'</p>
<p>&quot;The consultation proceeded; graver and graver
  grew the details; when, at a moment of extreme
  importance, the barber came again upon the scene,
  and the lawyer laughed loud and long.</p>
<p>&quot;'It's no use; I can't get rid of it,' he said to his
  astonished and indignant visitor. 'There is a
  drawing in <i>Punch</i> to-day that is so irresistibly funny
  that I can't get it out of my head, and I can't help
  laughing whenever I think of it.'</p>
<p>&quot;'I don't believe a single word you say!' said the
  angry client; 'and as you persist in treating my case
  with such insulting levity, I will go elsewhere, and
  endeavour to find someone who will attend to me.
  And as for you, sir, I will never trouble you again
  on this or any other matter.'</p>
<p>&quot;That,&quot; said Leech, &quot;is how my friend lost his
  client.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>
<h3>LOVE OF FIELD SPORTS.</h3>
<p>Leech had long passed his boyish days before his
  love for field sports showed itself in his works. I
  recollect his saying how fruitful of subject the
  hunting-field, the stubble, and the stream would
  prove to the artist who was also a sportsman. In
  his early works, dealing as they did chiefly with the
  London life of the street or the home, we find the
  horse playing an inferior part; and it was not till he
  felt the importance of varying his subjects, and of
  supplying the public with the sporting scenes they
  love so much, that, mounted by his friend Adams, he
  joined the &quot;Puckeridge&quot; and became one of the
  &quot;field.&quot;</p>
<p>Leech was a timid rider. He much preferred an
  open gate to a thickset hedge, and the highroad to
  either. He must, however, have frequently been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> full career with the &quot;field&quot;; how otherwise could he
  have acquired his knowledge of the thorough sportsman's
  seat on horseback, the cut of his clothes&mdash;correct
  even to the number of buttons&mdash;and, above
  all, display that Heaven-gifted power of showing the
  horse in repose, as well as in all the varieties of
  action? Landseer and all the animal-painters within
  my knowledge studied the horse from casts, often
  from the Elgin marbles, before they attempted
  drawing from the living animal. Landseer made
  himself acquainted with the superficial structure by
  dissection; but Leech, without any preparatory
  study whatever, drew the hunter, the cab-horse,
  the hackney, the rough pony, the cob&mdash;no matter
  which&mdash;in absolute perfection.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>
<img src="images/i_053.jpg" width="600" height="421" alt="" /> <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">&quot;Give Her Her Head, Jack.&quot;</span></span> </div>
<p>In the autograph letters which, through Mr.
  Adams' kindness, I am permitted to publish, Leech's
  constant charge to his friend to get him a horse
  suitable to a &quot;timid, elderly gentleman,&quot; or to give
  the animal some preliminary gallops himself so as to
  take the <i>freshness</i> out of him, prove, as I said before,
  that Leech was anything but a daring rider. In
  spite of his care, however, he had some ugly falls, in
  which, happily, his hat was the greatest sufferer.
  Numbers of the hunting scenes were <i>facts</i>, and the
  persons represented were Leech and his friend&mdash;notably<span class="pagenum"> <a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> one in which the artist is riding a mare
  afflicted with the &quot;freshness&quot; he dreaded, which his
  friend observing, shouts, &quot;Give her her head, Jack!
  give her her head!&quot; while it is pretty evident that
  more &quot;head&quot; will lead to the rider being swept from
  the saddle by the branches through which the mare
  is plunging.</p>

  <p> <span class="smcap">&quot;My dear Charley</span>,<br />
  </p>
  <p>&quot;You will see from the above address that
    I am still rusticating. I expect to be in town
    soon after the 12th of August, and then, after I have
    done my month's work, I am your man. You say
    when, and, if you are quite sure it will not distress
    Mrs. Adams, I will bring my wife with me. Charles
    Eaton [Mrs. Leech's brother] says he will come too.
    I am sure nothing would please him more than to
    run down to Barkway. Don't make yourself uncomfortable
    about the quantity of sport. I shall be
    quite satisfied with what you offer me. I rejoice to
    hear such good accounts of your wife and little ones.
    Pray give our united regards to her and them, and
    believe me ever,</p>
  <p class="tdr"> &quot;Yours faithfully,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
    <span class="smcap">&quot;John Leech.&quot;</span><br />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>
<img src="images/i_055.jpg" width="600" height="443" alt="" /> <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">&quot;Oh, if this is one of the places Charley spoke of, I shall go back!&quot;</span></span> </div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>
<p>Yet another fact. Somewhere in the Puckeridge
  country there is a deep gully, or dried-up watercourse,
  with precipitous sides, with which Leech,
  one hunting-morning, found himself face to face.
  Some of the &quot;field&quot; had crossed, and were climbing
  the opposite bank. Leech pulled up, and said to his
  friend:</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, if this is one of the places Charley spoke of,
  I shall go back!&quot;</p>
<p>I am able here to give the rough sketch, now in
  Mr. Adams' possession, from which the drawing
  was taken that afterwards appeared in <i>Punch</i>.</p>
<p>Some years ago I took my exercise chiefly on
  horseback, and, after risking my neck several times
  from the &quot;freshness&quot; of a thoroughbred mare, I
  thought it best to get rid of her. Amongst the rest
  of my horsey friends, I thought Leech would be
  likely to know of an animal that might suit me, and
  I spoke to him on the subject. Leech soon succeeded,
  and sent the horse for my inspection. The
  man who brought the animal for approval assured
  me that a child could ride him with perfect safety.
  I liked his looks, and bought him. My first and last
  ride upon my new purchase was to Rotten Row
  in the height of the season. Whether he was a
  horse of Radical or Socialistic principles, or not, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> cannot say; but what I soon discovered was a determined
  dislike to the aristocratic company in which he
  found himself; he shied at the ladies and kicked at
  the gentlemen, and finally took to what is called
  &quot;buck-jumping,&quot; an amusement which would speedily
  have relieved him of my company if I had not taken
  advantage of a momentary cessation of his antics and
  safely descended from his detestable back. Leech
  soon heard of &quot;the dangers I had passed,&quot; when he
  wrote to me as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="tdr"> &quot;6, The Terrace, Kensington,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
    &quot;Sunday.</p>
  <p> <span class="smcap">&quot;My dear Frith</span>,<br />
  </p>
  <p>&quot;I was shocked last night at the Garrick
    to hear from Elmore that I had nearly killed you
    through recommending a horse which had misbehaved
    himself in the Park. To be sure, I told
    you that I had been to look at an animal for my
    little girl, and that it did not suit, and I told you that
    it might be worth your looking at, as I had heard
    that it was young, sound, and steady; but if you ride
    a beast that you know nothing about in Rotten Row,
    and if that beast has not been out for a week, or
    probably a fortnight, I must protest against being
    made answerable for the consequences.  I most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> sincerely hope, however, that you are not hurt or
    come to grief in any way.</p>
  <p class="tdr"> &quot;Believe me,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

<p>It goes without saying that so true-hearted a man
  as John Leech, would be&mdash;as indeed he was&mdash;a
  model of the domestic virtues&mdash;the best of husbands
  and fathers, and a most dutiful and affectionate son.
  In evidence of the latter, I put before my readers
  some letters written to his parents in his maturer
  years, which will amply justify what I say of him.</p>

  <p>&quot;Thank you with my best love for thinking

    very heartily, I assure you. You will be glad to

  <p>&quot;Thank God they are thriving beautifully, which
    is a great happiness to me. I wish you could see
    them making dirt pies and gardens on the sands.
    A great many people notice them&mdash;indeed, although
    I say it, between you and me, I don't see any nicer
    little folks down here. If either you or papa could
    come here for a time we would endeavour to take the
    best care of you. I am no great hand at pen-and-inking,
    as you know, so you will excuse a very short
    note. I thought, however, that you would like to

<p>A great deal has been said&mdash;and with a certain
  amount of truth, no doubt&mdash;about the difference
  between a drawing on wood as it leaves the hands
  of the artist, and as it appears after its sufferings at
  the hands of the wood-engraver. Leech is reported
  to have replied to an admiring friend, who was
  extolling one of his drawings:</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, wait till you see what it looks like in <i>Punch</i> next week.&quot;</p>
<p>I once saw one of Leech's drawings on the wood,
  and I afterwards saw it in <i>Punch</i>, and I remember
  wondering at the fidelity with which it was rendered.
  Some of the lines, finer than the finest hair, had
  been cut away or <i>thickened</i>, but the character, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> vigour, and the beauty were scarcely damaged. To
  Mr. Swain, who for many years cut all Leech's
  drawings, the artist owed and acknowledged obligation;
  he thought himself fortunate in avoiding certain
  other wood-cutters, who were somewhat remorseless
  in their operations.</p>
<p>Mr. Swain, the wood-engraver, writes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;For twenty-five years I engraved nearly all
    Mr. Leech's drawings. I always found him kind,
    and willing to forgive any of my shortcomings in
    not rendering his touches in all things. My work
    was always against time. I seldom had more
    time than two days to engrave one of his drawings
    in.</p>
  <p>&quot;Photographing drawings on wood was not
    known in his time, or it would have been a great
    advantage to him; instead of drawing on the
    block, he would then have drawn on paper, as
    most artists do in the present day, and had
    his drawings photographed on the wood, thus
    preserving the finished drawings, which would
    have been of great value now; besides, it would
    have been a great help to the engraver, always
    to have the original drawing to refer to in engraving
    the blocks.</p>
  <p>&quot;He never had any models, and rarely ever made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> any sketches. He showed me a little note-book
    once with a few thumb-nail sketches of bits of background,
    but he seemed never to forget anything he
    saw, and could always go back in his memory for
    any little bit of country street he might want for
    background, etc.</p>
  <p>&quot;It was generally very late in the week before
    he could get his drawings ready, which gave very
    little time to the engraver to do justice to his
    work.</p>
  <p>&quot;His first introduction to <i>Punch</i> was through
    Mr. Percival Leigh.</p>
  <p>&quot;Mr. Leech was a man of very nervous temperament.
    I will give you an instance of this.
    Mr. Mark Lemon told me one day that Leech
    had been invited to a gentleman's house in the
    country for a few days' hunting. He arrived there
    in the evening. He was awakened early in the
    morning by a grating noise made by the gardener
    rolling the gravel under his window&mdash;noise he could
    never endure. This had such an effect upon his
    nerves, that he got up, packed his things, and was
    off to town before any of the family were aware
    of it. A barrel-organ was to him an instrument
    of torture.</p>
  <p>&quot;He had lived in Russell Square for many years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> but for some time before his death he took a large
    house&mdash;6, The Terrace, Kensington.</p>
  <p>&quot;I remember going to see him at his new house.
    He took great delight in showing me over it, and
    pointing out that he had had double windows put in
    all over the house <i>to keep all noises out</i>.&quot;</p>

<h3>INVENTORS AND ILLUSTRATORS.</h3>
<p>In looking at the plethora of lovely women's faces
  in the &quot;Pictures of Life and Character,&quot; the spectator
  may fairly ask himself to realize, if he can,
  anything more exquisite; and if he fail, he will also
  fail to imagine that the charming creatures could
  have suffered much in their passage from the wood
  to the paper.</p>
<p>I have said elsewhere that Charles Dickens was
  an occasional guest at the <i>Punch</i> Wednesday dinners;
  he was also an intimate friend of several of the writers,
  notably of Leech, Lemon, and Douglas Jerrold.
  Dickens was, of course, one of Thackeray's warmest
  admirers, but I am pretty sure that the friendship
  between those great men could never have
  reached intimacy. Though Leech failed in his
  application for the post of illustrator of the &quot;Pickwick
  Papers,&quot; he showed himself to be at one with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> the great writer in the etchings and woodcuts with
  which he ornamented Dickens' Christmas books, in
  conjunction with Stanfield, Maclise, Cattermole, and
  others. Though Leech's etchings are inferior as
  works of art to his wood-drawings, they still show
  the same beauty, and perfect realization of character;
  in this assertion I am borne out by the illustrations
  in the &quot;Christmas Carol,&quot; and by those in the
  &quot;Haunted Man and the Battle of Life.&quot;</p>
<p>In my own profession I have observed, almost as
  a rule, that the artist who habitually invents his own
  subjects&mdash;in other words, draws upon himself for
  original ideas&mdash;generally fails, comparatively, in his
  attempts to realize the ideas of others. May I not
  say the same of many writers? Dickens, for instance,
  wrote of the life about him; but if, like
  Scott, he had attempted to revive the past, would
  he have produced work worthy to rank with &quot;David
  Copperfield&quot;? Scott seems to me a still more conspicuous
  supporter of my theory, for he tried modern
  life in &quot;St. Ronan's Well,&quot; and produced a book incontestably
  inferior to &quot;Kenilworth.&quot;</p>
<p>Our historical painters have almost invariably
  failed in their attempts upon everyday life; this
  extends even to the painters of <i>genre</i>. Witness the
  works of the elder Leslie, who painted scenes from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> Shakespeare, Moli&egrave;re, and the poets of the last
  century, with a success that would have delighted
  the authors; but when he sought inspiration from
  the life about him, the result was far from satisfactory&mdash;conspicuous,
  indeed, in its contrast with his
  perfect rendering, of &quot;Sir Roger de Coverley&quot; or
  &quot;Uncle Toby,&quot; and the alluring &quot;Widow Wadman.&quot;</p>
<p>But the greatest of English painters is the
  greatest help to me in the contention into which I
  venture to enter. Hogarth was beguiled by a spirit,
  which must have been evil, into painting huge
  Scripture subjects. The <i>size</i> of these pictures,
  always of the proportion of full life, was unsuited to
  his hand, while the themes became ludicrous under
  his treatment. He failed completely also as an
  illustrator, witness his designs from &quot;Hudibras.&quot;
  In the Bristol Gallery, and in the Foundling Hospital,
  these specimens of perverted genius may be
  seen; and no one can look at them without regret
  that time should have been so misspent&mdash;time which
  might have given us another immortal series like the
  &quot;Marriage &agrave; la Mode.&quot;</p>

<img src="images/i_069.jpg" width="476" height="600" alt="" /> <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Jack Johnson&#39;s Attempt to Rescue Derval.</span></span> </div>
<p>I fancy I can hear my readers say&mdash;And what
  has all this to do with John Leech? Well,
  this: Leech is now about to pose as the destroyer,
  in his own person, of my theory&mdash;he is, in
  fact, the exception to my rule; for though the
  incidents in Albert Smith's &quot;Ledbury&quot; and &quot;Brinvilliers&quot;
  bear no comparison in human interest with
  the delightful transcripts of real life to be found in
  such profusion in the pictures of &quot;Life and
  Character,&quot; Leech's rendering of them could not be
  surpassed.</p>
<p>The tragic and humorous powers of the artist
  are fully displayed in the examples which follow.
  In the first, from &quot;Ledbury,&quot; &quot;Jack Johnson
  attempts to rescue Derval&quot;: the awful swirl of
  the river as it engulfs the drowning man, while his
  would-be rescuer, finding the stream too strong for
  him, clings frantically to a ring in the stonework of
  the bridge, a full moon lightning up the scene, and
  throwing the Pont Neuf which spans the Seine in
  the distance into deep shadow&mdash;all are combined with
  admirable skill into, perhaps, the most powerful
  etching and the most perfect illustration in the book.</p>
<p>In the second example the artist is in full sympathy
  with his author&mdash;&quot;Mrs. De Robinson holds a
  Conversazione of Talented People;&quot; and amongst
  them is &quot;the foreign gentleman who executes an air
  upon the grand piano.&quot; Here we have Leech using
  the scene as a peg upon which he can hang the
  humorous character in which he takes such hearty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
  healthy delight. The performer himself is scarcely
  a caricature of the foreign pianist; while his audience,
  not forgetting the deaf old lady in the corner&mdash;includes
  the affected gentleman, whose soul is in
  Elysium; together with a variety of types, in which
  &quot;lovely woman&quot; is not forgotten.</p>

<h3>&quot;INGOLDSBY LEGENDS.&quot;</h3>
<p>In the &quot;Ingoldsby Legends&quot; Leech found a very congenial
  field for the exercise of his powers. Though
  I will not presume to prophesy respecting literary
  merit, I venture to think that, during the course of
  his practice, Leech's illustrations have occasionally
  appeared attached to literature scarcely worthy of
  them; they will, doubtless, in some cases, act as the
  salt, which will preserve for posterity certain books of
  an ephemeral character. This remark cannot apply
  to the &quot;Ingoldsby Legends,&quot; which is a work that
  &quot;the world will not willingly let die,&quot; until delightful
  wit and humour, wedded to no less delightful verse,
  cease to charm. The burden of the illustrations of
  the &quot;Legends&quot; falls upon the worthy shoulders of
  John Tenniel, and they show some of the strongest
  work of that admirable artist. Leech appears in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> diminished force as to numbers, but in the examples
  I give he leaves nothing to wish for.</p>

<p>As this memoir progresses I propose to submit
  further illustrations from some of the many serials,
  novels, tales, poems, etc., with which Leech was connected.
  I also propose, in the course of my narrative,
  to quote opinions of Leech's powers from men better
  qualified to judge of them, and able to express their
  opinions in far more felicitous language than mine.
  Amongst those Dickens takes a foremost place. I
  think the friendship between Leech and Dickens
  began very early in the life of the former; the nature
  of Leech's work, and the modest and gentle character
  of the man, were especially attractive to Dickens.</p>
<p>In the amateur company of actors formed by
  Dickens, Leech was a conspicuous figure; but his
  heart was not in the work, though he entirely
  sympathized with the object of it, which was of a
  charitable nature, resulting in many performances&mdash;very
  successful in a pecuniary sense&mdash;for the benefit
  of poor and deserving literary men. The company
  consisted of Dickens, Mark Lemon, John Forster,
  G. H. Lewis, Douglas Jerrold, Leech, Egg, Wilkie
  Collins, Frank Stone, and others, who christened
  themselves &quot;The Guild of Literature and Art.&quot;
  The late Lord Lytton took great interest in the
  Guild, for which he wrote a play called &quot;Not so
  Bad as We Seem; or, Many Sides to a Character,&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> and to this he added a gift of land on his estate
  in Hertfordshire, where some houses of a superior
  cottage form were built, in which decayed artists
  and authors were to end their days; but these
  gentlemen declined to <i>begin</i> any days there under
  the conditions prescribed; and when the houses
  were built, tenants for them could not be found.
  The Guild, therefore, was something of a fiasco,
  with the exception of the relief it afforded in several
  instances to worthy objects.</p>
<p>Leech acted in the first play that the amateurs
  ventured upon, no less than Ben Jonson's &quot;Every
  Man in his Humour,&quot; in which Dickens played
  Bobadil and Leech Master Matthew. This occurred
  about 1847, I think, and I was honoured
  by an invitation to the first or second performance. <i>Par parenth&egrave;se</i>, I may add that I had the honour of
  being asked to join the company, but feeling that I
  could not learn a part, or, if I did get over that difficulty,
  the footlights would paralyze my memory,
  and also having neither face nor figure for the stage,
  I thought it best to &quot;stick to my last.&quot;</p>
<p>Though Leech had a good part in &quot;Every Man,&quot;
  strange to say, I have no recollection of his performance;
  though that of Dickens, Jerrold, Egg, and
  others remains vividly in my memory.  Dickens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> gave proofs in Bobadil, and in many other characters,
  that he might have been a great actor. The same,
  nor anything like it, could not be said with truth of
  Leech, if he played his other parts no better than
  he did that of Slender in the &quot;Merry Wives of
  Windsor.&quot; It is only in that character that I can
  remember him, though I must have seen him in
  others. The tone in which he said &quot;Oh, sweet
  Anne Page!&quot; can I ever forget? There was a ring
  of impatience in his performance, a kind of &quot;Oh,
  I wish this was all over!&quot; that was plainly perceptible
  to those who knew him intimately. Leech's
  tall figure and handsome face told well upon the
  stage, but with those his attractions as an actor
  ceased. In Lord Lytton's play Leech had no part,
  I think, but my old friend Egg played that of a
  poor poet, who is discovered in a miserable attic
  when the curtain rises, and the poet soliloquizes to
  the effect that &quot;Years ago, when under happier circumstances&quot;&mdash;something
  or other. Egg always
  begun, &quot;Here's a go, when under,&quot; etc. Unlike
  Leech, Egg was fond of acting, but, like Leech, he
  displayed no capacity for the art.</p>

<h3>DICKENS AND THACKERAY ON LEECH.</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most striking difference between
  Leech and the caricaturists who preceded him, as
  well as those who were his contemporaries, was
  shown in the part that beauty played in every drawing
  in which it could be appropriately introduced; he
  may be credited with the creation of many of the
  loveliest creatures that ever fell from the pencil of an
  artist. Leech revelled in beauty as Gillray and
  Rowlandson revelled in ugliness.</p>
<p>In 1841 a work appeared, in book-form, of
  sketches by Leech, entitled &quot;The Rising Generation,&quot;
  in which the rising youth, with their mannish
  manners, were satirized. Of this book Dickens
  wrote:</p>
<p>&quot;We enter our protest against those of the
  rising generation who are precociously in love being
  made the subject of merriment by a pitiless and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> unsympathizing world. We never saw a boy more
  distinctly in the right than the young gentleman
  kneeling in the chair to beg a lock of hair from his
  pretty cousin to take back to school. Madness is in
  her apron, and Virgil, dog-eared and defaced, is in
  her ringlets. Doubts may suggest themselves of the
  perfect disinterestedness of the other young gentleman
  contemplating the fair girl at the piano&mdash;doubts
  engendered by his worldly allusion to 'tin,' although
  that may have arisen in his modest consciousness of
  his own inability to support an establishment; but
  that he should be 'deucedly inclined to go and cut
  that fellow out' appears to us one of the most
  natural emotions of the human breast. The young
  gentleman with the dishevelled hair and clasped
  hands, who loves the transcendent beauty with the
  bouquet and can't be happy without her, is to us
  a withering and desolate spectacle. Who <i>could</i> be
  happy without her? The growing youths are not
  less happily observed and depicted than the grown
  women. The languid little creature, who 'hasn't
  danced since he was quite a boy,' is perfect; and
  the eagerness of the small dancer, whom he declines
  to receive for a partner at the hands of the glorious
  old lady of the house (the little feet quite ready for
  the first position, the whole heart projected into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> quadrille, and the glance peeping timidly at the
  desired one out of a flutter of hope and doubt), is
  quite delightful to look at. The intellectual youth,
  who awakens the tremendous wrath of a Norma of
  private life by considering woman an inferior animal,
  is lecturing at the present moment, we understand,
  on the Concrete in connection with the Will. The
  legs of the young philosopher who considers Shakespeare
  an overrated man were seen by us dangling
  over the side of an omnibus last Tuesday. We
  have no acquaintance with the scowling young
  gentleman, who is clear that 'if his governor don't
  like the way he is going on, why, he must have
  chambers and so much a week;' but, if he is not by
  this time in Van Diemen's Land, he will certainly go
  to it through Newgate. We should exceedingly
  dislike to have personal property in a strong-box, to
  live in the quiet suburb of Camberwell, and to be
  in the relation of bachelor uncle to that youth. In
  all his designs, whatever Mr. Leech desires to do he
  does. His drawing seems to us charming, and the
  expression, indicated by the simplest means, is
  exactly the natural expression, and is recognised
  as such at once. Some forms of our existing life
  will never have a better chronicler. His wit is
  good-natured, and always the wit of a gentleman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> He has a becoming sense of responsibility and
  restraint; he delights in agreeable things, and he
  imparts some pleasant air of his own to things not
  pleasant in themselves; he is suggestive and full of
  matter, and he is always improving. Into the tone
  as well as into the execution of what he does, he has
  brought a certain elegance which is altogether new,
  without involving any compromise of what is true.
  Popular art in England has not had so rich an
  acquisition.&quot;</p>
<p>In the endeavour to satisfy Dickens with the type
  required for the characters in his stories, Leech encountered
  the difficulty that all the author's illustrators
  had to master. &quot;Phiz&quot; made many drawings
  in Dickens' presence before he could realize the
  author's idea of Mr. Dombey; Cruikshank was
  more than once required to redraw a whole scene
  from &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;; and Leech has often been
  heard to speak of the minute details as to feature,
  height, thinness or fatness&mdash;in fact, every physical
  and, so far as it could be shown by appearance,
  mental quality&mdash;that Dickens insisted upon before he
  could be satisfied with the <i>vera effigies</i> of one of his
  characters. The feelings of the great author, then,
  may be imagined when he found&mdash;too late for correction&mdash;a
  terrible error into which Leech had fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> in the drawing of a scene from &quot;The Battle of Life,&quot;
  by introducing a personage into a scene which closes
  the second part of the tale, who was not intended to
  have been present.</p>
<p>It was in December, 1846, that &quot;The Battle of
  Life&quot; made one of the series of Christmas stories.
  In Leech's unfortunate illustration, which represented
  the flight of the bride, he made the mistake
  of supposing that Michael Warden had taken part
  in the elopement, and introduced his figure with that
  of Marian. Leech's error was not discovered until
  too late for remedy, the publication of the book
  having been delayed to the utmost limit expressly
  for those drawings; and it is highly characteristic of
  Dickens, and of the true regard he had for the artist,
  that, knowing the pain he must inflict, under the
  circumstances, by complaining, he never reproached
  Leech; excusing him, no doubt, on the ground of
  the hurry and confusion under which so much of his
  work was produced; but anyone who reads the story
  carefully will see what havoc the mistake makes of
  one of the most delicate turns in it.</p>
<p>Dickens wrote thus to Forster in reference to the
  grievous error: &quot;When I first saw it, it was with a
  horror and agony not to be expressed. Of course,
  I need not tell <i>you</i>, my dear fellow, that Warden had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> no business in the elopement scene; he was never
  there. In the first hot sweat of this surprise and
  novelty, I was going to implore that the printing of
  that sheet might be stopped, and the figure taken
  out of the block; but when I thought of the pain
  this might give to our kind-hearted Leech, and that
  what is such a monstrous enormity to me as never
  entered my brain, may not so present itself to others,
  I became more composed, though the fact is wonderful
  to me. No doubt a great number of copies
  will be printed by the time this reaches you, and
  therefore I shall take it for granted that it stands as
  it is. Leech otherwise is very good, and the illustrations
  altogether are by far the best that have been
  done for any of my Christmas books.&quot;</p>
<p>It may appear presumptuous in me to differ from
  Dickens in respect to the illustrations to &quot;The Battle
  of Life&quot;; but, in my opinion, these are not to be
  compared favourably with those of the &quot;Christmas
  Carol.&quot; With the well-known readiness of people
  to ferret out mistakes, it seems strange that the illustrator's
  mistake was never publicly noticed.</p>
<p>The first series of &quot;The Pictures of Life and
  Character,&quot; reprinted from <i>Punch</i>, appeared in 1854.
  They were heartily welcomed by the public; and it
  is as follows that Thackeray, Leech's intimate friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> speaks of them in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, in an article
  published at that time:</p>
<p>&quot;This book is better than plum-cake at Christmas.
  It is one enduring plum-cake, which you may
  eat, and which you may slice and deliver to your
  friends, and to which, having cut it, you may come
  again, and welcome, from year's end to year's end.
  In the frontispiece you see Mr. Punch examining
  the pictures in his gallery&mdash;a portly, well-dressed,
  middle-aged, respectable gentleman, in a white neck-cloth
  and a polite evening costume, smiling in a
  very bland and agreeable manner upon one of his
  pleasant drawings, taken out of one of his handsome
  portfolios. Mr. Punch has very good reason to smile
  at the work and be satisfied with the artist. Mr.
  Leech, his chief contributor, and some hundred
  humorists, with pencil and pen, have served Mr.
  Punch admirably. There is no blinking the fact
  that in Mr. Punch's cabinet John Leech is the
  right-hand man.</p>
<p>&quot;Fancy a number of <i>Punch</i> without John Leech's
  pictures! What would you give for it? The
  learned gentlemen who wrote the book must feel
  that without him it were as well left alone. Look
  at the rivals whom the popularity of <i>Punch</i> has
  brought into the field&mdash;the direct imitators of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> Leech's manner&mdash;the artists with a manner of their
  own. How inferior their pencils are to his humour
  in depicting the public manners, in arresting and
  amusing the nation! The truth, the strength, the
  free vigour, the kind humour, the John Bull pluck
  and spirit of that hand are approached by no competitor.
  With what dexterity he draws a horse,
  a woman, a child! He feels them all, so to speak,
  like a man. What plump young beauties those are
  with which Mr. Punch's chief contributor supplies
  the old gentleman's pictorial harem! What famous
  thews and sinews Mr. Punch's horses have, and
  how Briggs on the back of them scampers across
  the country! You see youth, strength, enjoyment,
  manliness, in those drawings, and in none more so,
  to our thinking, than in the hundred pictures of
  children which this artist loves to design. Like
  a brave, hearty, good-natured Briton, he becomes
  quite soft and tender with the little creatures, pats
  gently their little golden heads, and watches with
  unfailing pleasure their ways, their jokes, laughter,
  caresses. <i>Enfants terribles</i> come home from Eton,
  young miss practising her first flirtation, poor little
  ragged Polly making dirt-pies in the gutter, or
  staggering under the weight of her nurse-child, who
  is as big as herself&mdash;all these little ones, patrician and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> plebeian, meet with kindness from this kind heart,
  and are watched with curious anxiety by this amiable
  observer.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, anyone who looks over Mr. Leech's portfolio
  must see that the social pictures which he gives
  us are authentic. What comfortable little drawing-rooms
  and dining-rooms, what snug libraries, we
  enter! What fine young gentlemanly wags they
  are, those beautiful little dandies, who wake up
  gouty old grandpapa to ring the bell; who decline
  aunt's pudding and custards, saying that they will
  reserve themselves for anchovy-toast with the claret;
  who talk together behind ball-room doors, where
  Fred whispers Charley, pointing to a dear little
  partner seven years old, 'My dear Charley, she has
  very much gone off; you should have seen that girl
  last season!'</p>
<p>&quot;Look well at the economy of the famous Mr.
  Briggs. How snug, quiet, and appropriate all the
  appointments are! What a comfortable, neat,
  clean, middle-class house Briggs' is (in the Bayswater
  suburb of London, we should guess from the
  sketches of the surrounding scenery)! What a
  good stable he has, with a loose-box for those
  celebrated hunters which he rides! How pleasant,
  clean, and warm his breakfast-table looks! What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> a trim maid brings in the boots that horrify
  Mrs. B.! What a snug dressing-room he has,
  complete in all its appointments, and in which he
  appears trying on that delightful hunting-cap which
  Mrs. Briggs flings into the fire! How cosy all the
  Briggs party seem in their drawing-room, Briggs
  reading a treatise on dog-breaking by a lamp,
  mamma and grannie with their respective needlework,
  the children clustering round a big book of
  prints&mdash;a great book of prints such as this before us,
  at this season, must make thousands of children
  happy by as many firesides! The inner life of all
  these people is represented. Leech draws them as
  naturally as Teniers depicts Dutch boors, or Morland
  pigs and stables. It is your house and mine;
  we are looking at everybody's family circle. Our
  boys, coming from school, give themselves such airs,
  the young scapegraces! Our girls, going to parties,
  are so tricked out by fond mammas&mdash;a social history
  of London in the middle of the nineteenth century.
  As such future students&mdash;lucky they to have a book
  so pleasant!&mdash;will regard these pages; even the
  mutations of fashion they may follow here, if they
  be so inclined. Mr. Leech has as fine an eye for
  tailory and millinery as for horseflesh. How they
  change, these cloaks and bonnets! How we have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> pay milliners' bills from year to year! Where are
  those prodigious <i>chatelaines</i> of 1850, which no lady
  could be without? Where are those charming
  waistcoats, those <i>stunning</i> waistcoats, which our
  young girls used to wear a few seasons back, and
  which caused 'Gus, in the sweet little sketch of 'La
  Mode,' to ask Ellen for her tailor's address? 'Gus
  is a young warrior by this time, very likely facing
  the enemy at Inkerman; and pretty Ellen, and that
  love of a sister of hers, are married and happy, let
  us hope, superintending one of those delightful
  nursery scenes which our artist depicts with such
  tender humour. Fortunate artist, indeed! You
  see he must have been bred at a good public school,
  and that he has ridden many a good horse in his
  day; paid, no doubt out of his own pocket, for the
  originals of those lovely caps and bonnets; and
  watched paternally the ways, smiles, frolics, and
  slumbers of his favourite little people.</p>
<p>&quot;As you look at the drawings, secrets come out of
  them&mdash;private jokes, as it were, imparted to you by
  the author for your special delectation. How remarkably,
  for instance, has Mr. Leech observed the
  hairdressers of the present age! Mr. Tongs, whom
  that hideous old bald woman who ties on her bonnet
  at the glass informs that 'she has used the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> bottle of Balm of California, but her hair comes off
  yet'&mdash;you can see the bears' grease not only on
  Tongs' head, but on his hands, which he is clapping
  clammily together. Remark him who is telling his
  client 'there is cholera in the hair,' and that lucky
  rogue whom that young lady bids to cut off a long
  thick piece&mdash;for somebody, doubtless. All these
  men are different and delightfully natural and absurd.
  Why should hairdressing be an absurd profession?</p>
<p>&quot;The amateur will remark what an excellent part
  hands play in Mr. Leech's pieces; his admirable
  actors use them with perfect naturalness. Look at
  Betty putting down the urn; at cook laying her
  hands upon the kitchen-table, whilst the policeman
  grumbles at the cold meat. They are cooks' and
  housemaids' hands without mistake, and not without
  a certain beauty, too. That bald old lady tying on
  her bonnet at Tongs' has hands which you see are
  trembling. Watch the fingers of the two old harridans
  who are talking scandal; for what long years
  they have pointed out holes in their neighbours'
  dresses and mud on their flounces!</p>
<p>&quot;'Here's a go! I've lost my diamond ring!'</p>
<p>&quot;As the dustman utters this pathetic cry and looks
  at his hands, you burst out laughing. These are
  among the little points of humour. One could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> indicate hundreds of such as one turns over the
  pleasant pages.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a little snob, or gent, whom we all of
  us know, who wears little tufts on his little chin,
  outrageous pins and pantaloons, smokes cigars on
  tobacconists' counters, sucks his cane in the streets,
  struts about with Mrs. Snob and the baby (the
  latter an immense woman, whom Snob nevertheless
  bullies), who is a favourite abomination of Leech,
  and pursued by that savage humourist into a thousand
  of his haunts. There he is choosing at the
  tailor's&mdash;such waistcoats! Yonder he is giving a
  shilling to the sweeper who calls him 'Capting.'
  Now he is offering a paletot to a huge giant who is
  going out in the rain. They don't know their own
  pictures very likely; if they did, they would have
  a meeting, and thirty or forty of them would be
  deputed to thrash Mr. Leech. One feels a pity for
  the poor little bucks.</p>
<p>&quot;Just one word to the unwary specially to note the
  backgrounds of landscapes in Leech's drawings&mdash;homely
  drawings of moor and wood and sea-shore
  and London street&mdash;the scenes of his little dramas.
  They are as excellently true to nature as the actors
  themselves. Our respect for the genius and humour
  which invented both increases as we look and look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> again at the designs. May we have more of them&mdash;more
  pleasant Christmas volumes over which we
  and our children may laugh together! Can we
  have too much of truth and fun and beauty and
  kindness?&quot;</p>
<p>In this delightfully appreciative spirit wrote
  Thackeray&mdash;a man of profounder genius than
  Leech&mdash;of his friend's work. It is said that when
  he was asked to name the most intimate and dearest
  friend of his life, Thackeray replied, &quot;John Leech.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>
<h3>DEAN HOLE.</h3>
<p>In 1858 a second series of &quot;Pictures of Life and
  Character,&quot; and later a third, were presented to a
  delighted public. The history of the immortal
  Briggs, collected from <i>Punch's</i> pages, was also
  published in separate form. In this year Leech
  made the acquaintance of the Rev. S. Reynolds
  Hole, now Dean of Rochester, a kindred spirit,
  whose admiration of the artist's work had long
  created a burning desire for his personal acquaintance.
  It was upon Easter Monday that the first
  meeting took place, and thus Mr. Hole describes
  very correctly Leech's appearance:</p>
<p>&quot;Well, he was very like my idea of him, only
  'more so.' A slim, elegant figure, over six feet in
  height, with a grand head, on which nature had
  written 'gentleman'&mdash;with wonderful genius in his
  ample forehead; wonderful penetration, observation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> humour, in his blue-gray Irish eyes; and wonderful
  sweetness, sympathy and mirth about his lips, which
  seemed to speak in silence.&quot;</p>
<p>These words bring my old friend again before me,
  but I think Mr. Hole fails to notice the slight shadow
  of melancholy that was never long absent from his
  handsome face. Mr. Hole says that, vividly as the
  first interview comes back to him, he can recall but
  little of the conversation. It appears Leech had
  been out with the hounds on this special Monday, in
  company with his friend Adams, in the Belvoir
  country, where his presence soon became known to
  the &quot;field&quot;; and Leech as speedily discovered, by
  the whisperings among the sportsmen, that he was
  expected to perform acts of horsemanship which
  would throw those of &quot;Herne the Hunter&quot; into
  insignificance. &quot;He being the quietest and most
  retiring of riders, much as he loved the sport, and
  never going over a fence if he could find a gap or
  a gate, it seemed, nevertheless, to be the general
  impression and belief of the yeomen who followed
  his Grace of Rutland's hounds that when a fox was
  found the celebrated Mr. Leech would utter a wild
  Irish yell, clench his teeth, put both spurs into his
  steed, and bound over the country like a mad buck.
  His complete inaptitude for these gymnastics, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> the consequent disgust and disappointment of the
  agricultural interest when he made early deviation
  from the chase in favour of the King's highway,
  seemed to please him vastly.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Hole also speaks enthusiastically of his first
  meeting Thackeray at a dinner at Leech's, when he
  and Thackeray stood up together, like Thornhill
  and Olivia in the &quot;Vicar of Wakefield,&quot; to see which
  was the taller. Mr. Hole won the day by proving
  himself to be two inches &quot;longer&quot; than Thackeray,
  who was six feet two, the longer gentleman being
  six feet four.</p>
<p>The story of Thackeray and a very tall friend
  going to see a giant, and being asked by the man
  at the door of the exhibition if they &quot;were in the
  business,&quot; I have heard told differently. My friend
  Alfred Elmore, R.A., who was intimate with
  Thackeray, in speaking of that great writer's personal
  appearance (which, never prepossessing, had
  been injured by a broken nose acquired in the same
  way as that misfortune happened to Michael Angelo),
  told me that he&mdash;Thackeray&mdash;was passing by an
  exhibition of a giant, when the humour took him to
  ask the man at the door if he was in want of a giant.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the man, &quot;yes, we do; but not such
  a d&mdash;&mdash;d ugly one as you.&quot;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<p>&quot;John Leech's consideration for others,&quot; says
  Mr. Hole, &quot;was patent wherever he went; but his
  anxiety for his friends and their enjoyment and
  amusement in his own house was a very winsome
  sight to see.... Far too much of a gentleman to
  be a gourmand, though he was wont to say he
  deserved a good dinner when he had done a hard
  day's work, and that, as a matter of economy, he was
  reluctantly compelled to eat and drink of the best
  lest he should injure his manipulation, he seemed to
  think, nevertheless, that his guests were bound to
  be greedy, and that it was his duty to provide the
  material. I remember that on one occasion the
  strawberries were so large that he put the largest
  on a plate and handed it to a servant, with a request
  that it might be carved on the sideboard.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Hole gives a charming picture of Leech and
  himself in the sunny glades of Sherwood Forest.
  After lamenting that the country might be dull to
  the artist with only his friend's company to amuse
  him, and expressing his anxiety on the subject, he
  says:</p>
<p>&quot;I soon saw that my anxiety was foolish. It was
  evidently, as he said, a grand enjoyment to him
  simply to sit under a tree and rest; to hear the
  throstle instead of the hurdy-gurdy; to see the sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> instead of the smoke.... He could only sigh his
  admiration. Presently he opened his pocket sketch-book,
  and put a point to his pencil; but he turned
  from one bit of loveliness to another as he sauntered
  on, and soon closed his book in a kind of profound but
  calm resignation. 'Much too beautiful for work,' he
  said; 'I can do no work to-day.' So we sat among
  the bracken, and drank that delicious air....&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Hole was, and perhaps still is, a great rose-grower;
  and the day after the forest walk he gave a
  garden-party in honour of Leech and the roses.
  The roses, it appears, were not only brilliant in
  their summer glory on their native trees, but also
  glorious indeed on the faces of the young ladies
  who fluttered about Leech, &quot;with evident expectation
  of having their portraits taken, for the future
  admiration of the world.&quot; All this was delightful to
  Leech, but not &quot;to one young man of sullen temperament,
  who, after watching the idol of his heart
  'making up,' as he called it, to Leech with her fascinations,
  retired to a shrubbery to smoke, and murmured
  a desire to 'punch that fellow's head.'...&quot; I
  can well imagine the pleasure of Leech in all his kind
  friends' care to gratify him; and I can also imagine
  &quot;the perplexity and annoyance&quot; with which he
  listened to the lady&mdash;let us hope she was neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> pretty nor young&mdash;who made him a speech in which
  she ended by telling him he was &quot;the delight of the
  nation.&quot;</p>
<p>It was in the evening of the day of the rose-show
  that Leech proposed a visit to Ireland for a fortnight's
  holiday, begging his friend to go with him.
  To this Mr. Hole consented, little dreaming that on
  the following morning, just as he was leaving, Leech
  would say to him, &quot;You must write your impressions,
  and I will illustrate.&quot; Mr. Hole's modesty took
  alarm, but with no reason, as the &quot;Impressions&quot;
  subsequently proved. The result of this trip was
  the publication, in 1859, of a volume entitled, &quot;A
  Little Tour in Ireland; being a visit to Dublin,
  Limerick, Killarney, Cork,&quot; etc., by an &quot;Oxonian.&quot;
  The &quot;Oxonian&quot; was, of course, Mr. Hole; and the
  illustrations showed Leech in his happiest vein.
  These were in the form of coloured folding-plates
  and numerous woodcuts.</p>
<p>The travellers did a great deal in the fortnight.
  They saw &quot;Dublin, Galway, the wild grandeur of
  Connemara, the scenery of the Shannon from Athlone
  to Limerick, the gentle loveliness of Killarney, the
  miniature prettiness of Glengariff, and that 'beautiful
  city called Cork.' ... Ah me, how happy we were!
  Looking from the steamer at the calm phosphorescent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> waves (so thankful they were calm, for we were
  miserable mariners, though Leech had represented
  himself in a letter as revelling in stormy seas), or
  gliding along the rails, or riding in cars, or rowing
  in boats; listening to quaint carmen, oarsmen, and
  guides; talking and laughing in genial converse
  with each other, or silent in the serene fruition of the
  exquisite scenery around....&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Hole had ample opportunity for seeing
  Leech's method of making notes from nature. It
  was not sketching from nature in the true sense of
  the phrase, but simply memoranda, in a kind of
  shorthand, which was afterwards elaborated into
  backgrounds, which are as true to nature as the
  figures they relieve and foil. The same with faces
  that attracted the artist from their peculiarities of
  character or expression; a few touches were sufficient
  as guides for the finished heads and figures. I
  have some examples in a sketch-book in my possession.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; says Mr. Hole, &quot;escaped him that
  was in any way absurd, abnormal, incongruous, or in
  any way ridiculous; and a touch of his elbow or a
  turn of his thumb drew my attention continually to
  something amusing in the aspect or the remarks of
  those about us at the <i>table d'h&ocirc;te</i>, or the steamer, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> public car, which else, in my obtuseness, I had never
  relished.... It was always his rule, however
  pressed for time, surrounded with engagements, or
  enticed by pleasures, never to 'scamp' his work.
  Sometimes his rapidity of execution was marvellous,
  but there was never haste. I have known him to
  send off from my own house three finished drawings
  on the wood, designed, traced, and rectified, without
  much effort, as it seemed, between breakfast and
  dinner. How I wish that the world could have seen
  those blocks! They were entrusted, no doubt, to
  the most skilful gravers of the day, but the exquisite
  fineness, clearness, the faultless grace and harmony
  of the drawing, could not be reproduced. If the position
  of an eyelash was altered, or the curve of a lip
  was changed, there might be an ample remainder to
  convey the intention and to win the admiration of
  those who never knew their loss, but the <i>perfection</i> of the original was gone. Again and again I have
  heard him sigh as he looked over the new number
  of <i>Punch</i>; and as I, seeing nothing but excellence,
  would ask an explanation, he would point to some
  almost imperceptible obliquity which vexed his
  gentle soul.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Hole continued to be the intimate friend of
  Leech during the latter part of a life that was indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> &quot;too short for friendship, not for fame&quot;; and he
  speaks of the many eminent men whom he met at
  Leech's house, with the gratification that might be
  expected from one who was fully able to share in the
  &quot;flow of soul&quot; that distinguished those meetings.</p>

<h3>TYPES.</h3>
<p>During one of the &quot;sittings&quot; which Dickens gave
  me when I painted his portrait, I asked him if, when
  he drew the character of Pecksniff, any of his inspiration
  had arisen from a knowledge of the character,
  and even personal appearance, of an individual
  known to both of us, whose name I mentioned.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, yes,&quot; was the reply; &quot;I had him in my
  eye.&quot;</p>
<p>In like manner, I think, in his most favourite type
  of beauty, Leech was thinking of his wife, who was
  in all respects a charming woman. She permeates
  a little to the destruction of variety of character
  many of the lovely figures in <i>Punch</i>, where now and
  again may be found an excellent likeness of Mrs.
  Leech. That she was a striking person is evident
  from the fact that she struck Leech to the heart
  as he met her in the street; so hard was the blow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> that the artist forgot his errand, and followed the
  enslaver to her own door. Inquiries were set on
  foot; an introduction followed; he came, he saw,
  conquered, and was married in 1843 to Miss Eaton,
  who made the best of wives and mothers.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that Leech was a worshipper
  of female beauty in all its bewitching variety.
  I remember watching with him the riders in Rotten
  Row, and after some startlingly lovely creatures
  had passed us, he said:</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, my Frith, don't you wish you were a Turk,
  and able to marry all that little lot?&quot;</p>
<p>Only two of Leech's children lived to maturity,
  and both survived him. His son, John Charles
  Warrington Leech&mdash;a fine boy, whom I well remember&mdash;was
  the darling of his father's heart, and
  the boy returned his love with all the fervour of his
  loving nature. If Leech had lived to learn that his
  son was accidentally drowned by the capsizing of a
  boat at South Adelaide&mdash;a deplorable event that
  took place in 1876&mdash;the intelligence would have
  broken his heart. This affliction was mercifully
  averted from him, as also was the death of his
  daughter, which occurred a few years ago, soon
  after she became a happy mother.</p>
<p>Leech's working coat was made of black velvet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> something in shape like a shooting-coat; Leech the
  younger, at the age of five, was allowed to dress
  exactly like his father; and he might have been
  seen on most mornings, palette in hand, standing
  before a little easel, working away at copies of the
  engravings in the <i>Illustrated London News</i>, which
  he coloured literally with all the colours of the rainbow,
  whilst the father sat by with block and pencil.
  The young gentleman not only inherited his father's
  love of art, but also some of his humour; for he
  informed a new servant, who appeared for the first
  time in the nursery, that his papa said that he was
  &quot;one of those children that can only be managed by
  kindness&quot;&mdash;&quot;So please go and get me some sponge-cake
  and an orange.&quot; This served Leech for an
  excellent cut in <i>Punch</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Hole gives another instance of Master Leech's
  Leech-like cleverness. He says:</p>
<p>&quot;My wife's maid had paid a long visit to the
  nursery for a chat with his lady-in-waiting, and
  when he began some display of disobedience, she
  said:</p>
<p>&quot;'Really, Master Leech, if you won't be good, I
  must tell your mamma.'</p>
<p>&quot;'And I shall tell her,' he rejoined, 'if you do,
  what a time you've been idling here.'&quot;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>
<p>I may add in this place an anecdote sent to me
  by an intimate lady friend of Leech's, who, after
  speaking of his devotion to his wife and children,
  tells me that she was taking luncheon with him one
  day at his house in Brunswick Square.</p>
<p>&quot;His two children dined at the same time.
  Leech said with a very grave voice:</p>
<p>&quot;'Now, children, say your grace.'</p>
<p>&quot;Both children began to say it together as fast as
  they could. Leech said when they had finished:</p>
<p>&quot;'Well run&mdash;Ada first, Bougie a good second.'&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hall, a daughter of Mr. Adams&mdash;the
  Chattie of Leech's letters&mdash;supplies me with an
  example, &quot;one out of many instances of great kindness
  to her as a child,&quot; which I present to my
  readers:</p>
<p>&quot;I was about eight years old,&quot; says Mrs. Hall,
  &quot;and on one rough morning during my stay with
  him at Broadstairs I was sent in charge of a maid to
  play upon the beach. The wind carried away my
  bonnet. Regardless of danger, I rushed into the
  sea after it, and after many struggles I recovered it,
  but was horrified to find that a crowd had collected
  round me. I was taken home dripping, and feeling
  very guilty. You can imagine the relief it was to
  find my dear friend ready to comfort and not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> scold; and I have a happy recollection of being
  snugly tucked up on his knee for some hours after
  the event, while he continued his drawing.&quot;</p>
<p>The publication of my desire for information
  respecting John Leech's youthful days has put
  into my possession one of his earliest drawings;
  for this I am indebted to one of his Charterhouse
  schoolfellows, a very young old gentleman indeed.
  Mr. Charles Maitland Tate's name may be found in
  the first division of the fourth form in the list of
  scholars of 1828. Mr. Maitland's first acquaintance
  with &quot;little Johnny Leech&quot; began at Brighton in
  1823, where he found our embryo six-year-old artist
  learning equestrian accomplishments, with the help
  of a small pony and the instruction of &quot;an old retired
  jockey,&quot; who was one of the stable servants of
  George IV. at the Pavilion.</p>
<p>&quot;Leech was a gentle, dear little fellow,&quot; says Mr.
  Maitland. &quot;I accompanied him on several of his
  pony excursions, and the more I saw of him, the
  better I liked him.&quot;</p>
<p>Leech was entered at Charterhouse in 1824,
  Maitland a year or two afterwards, having grown
  into a strapping boy of eleven. Mr. Maitland's
  father was a Dean of St. Paul's, able, no doubt,
  from his position to procure a presentation&mdash;as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> did from Lord Grey&mdash;for his son, who entered as
  a Gown boy, thus taking, and maintaining, a higher
  position in the school than Leech ever succeeded in
  reaching. Young Maitland had been a few days in
  the Charterhouse, when he was accosted by a small
  boy, who was obliged to tell his name before his
  early friend could recognise him. Boy-like, Maitland
  immediately took young Leech under his protection,
  and threatened dire consequences to anyone
  who bullied or ill-treated him. The protector's
  prowess, however, was not wanted, for Leech never
  made an enemy then or afterwards.</p>
<p>Amongst the scholars was one named Douglas,
  whose powers of sketching in caricature were very
  remarkable. Of this I convinced myself by a book
  of drawings in the possession of Mr. Maitland.
  Douglas's talent made him very attractive to Leech,
  and the boys became great friends.</p>
<p>&quot;Leech copied several of his friend's drawings,&quot;
  says Mr. Maitland; but, as might have been expected,
  he soon abandoned copying and took to
  original work, a specimen of which I give below,
  as perhaps the earliest known drawing by Leech.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>
<p>If, before I had written the first portion of this
  book, I had known Mr. Maitland's story, I should
  have introduced it earlier; for this and other shortcomings
  and irregularities, I hope to be forgiven on
  the ground of my inexperience and ignorance of the
  laws of literary composition. With this apology I
  proceed to make more mistakes, but mistakes only
  in the <i>order</i> in which the <i>truth</i> should be told.</p>

<h3>LEECH AND HIS PREDECESSORS.</h3>
<p>John Leech may be truly said to be <i>sui generis</i>;
  there has been nothing like him before his time, or
  since his bright and short career ended. It would
  be difficult to imagine a greater contrast than that
  existing between the works of Leech and those of
  his predecessors, at the head and front of whom
  must be placed Hogarth, who stands <i>longo intervallo</i> above any of his successors. In his terrible
  lashing of the vices and follies of his own time&mdash;vices
  and follies that are common to all time&mdash;Hogarth
  sometimes, though rarely, indulged in an
  exaggeration of character amounting to caricature.
  Leech dealt with the life about him in a totally different
  spirit; his was a lighter, a more genial, and a kinder
  hand. Unlike Hogarth, he made us laugh at the
  follies of our fellow-creatures, and would have nothing
  to do with their vices, though he has shown us in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> many examples how keen was his sympathy with
  the poor and the oppressed, and how intense was
  his hatred of the oppressor. The name of caricaturist
  is as inappropriate to Leech as it is to Hogarth,
  though instances may be found, as in Hogarth, of
  occasional indulgence in exaggeration. These
  examples are mostly to be found in the illustration
  of books which in themselves somewhat outrage the
  modesty of nature. Hogarth's pictures are often
  disfigured by a coarseness closely bordering on
  indecency; instances may, indeed, be found where
  the great artist has passed the border with revolting
  audacity. In the thousands of drawings by Leech,
  instead of the <i>double entendre</i>, we have some delightful
  trait of child-life; instead of the adulterous
  husband, we have paterfamilias living a
  healthy, happy life among his children, only amused
  at his schoolboy son's tricks played upon his
  sisters.</p>
<p>Consideration should, no doubt, be shown to
  Hogarth and his immediate successors in respect of
  the coarseness of the time in which they lived; certainly
  the works of Bunbury, Woodward, Rowlandson
  and Gillray require all the excuses that can be
  made for them. Compared to the two latter-named
  artists, the two former may be said to be harmless.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> In the hands of all four, however, caricature reigned
  triumphant.</p>
<p>Rowlandson had less excuse for the constant displays
  of vulgarity and ugliness that abound in his
  works, than the other designers, who were destitute
  of any sense of beauty. It was not so with Rowlandson.
  I have seen early drawings by him full of
  the charm of beauty in women: refined, and graceful.
  This power, which one would have thought was a
  part of the man's nature, vanished altogether as he
  advanced in life; swamped in the whirl of dissipation
  in which he lived, his originally better nature
  became utterly vulgarized by his surroundings.
  That Rowlandson had a certain very coarse humour,
  a facility in grouping masses of figures in large
  compositions, and a power of inventing faces and
  figures for which he had no authority in nature,
  cannot be denied; but there is always an intense
  vulgarity, in which the man seems to revel with as
  intense a pleasure.</p>
<p>Gillray altogether differed from Rowlandson, both
  in his subjects and in the way he treated them. In
  politics he was a savage partisan, lashing his opponents
  with merciless fury and cruel personality.
  Gillray was in art what Churchill was in literature.
  He had a grim humour all his own; witness his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> constant attacks upon Bonaparte, then, and always,
  the <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i> of this country. There are many
  examples in which the Corsican tyrant is made
  ridiculous, ferocious, or cowardly, according to the
  events of the time and the humour of the artist.</p>
<p>In a parody of Belshazzar's feast, Bonaparte, as
  Belshazzar, has caught sight of the writing on the
  wall; he looks with extended arms and an expression
  of cowardly horror at the warning. By his side sits
  the Empress, an outrage upon the fattest of fat women,
  ill-drawn and vulgar in the extreme. A man with
  a face hideous beyond the dreams of ugliness (caricature <i>in excelsis</i>) is devouring the Tower of London,
  which figures as a <i>plat</i> in the banquet; the rest
  of the guests round the monarch's table, vying with
  the dreadful gourmand in repulsiveness, are one and
  all caricatured out of nature. The meats provided
  for this singular entertainment consist of what may
  be called English fare, the <i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i> in
  front of Bonaparte, which he will presently demolish,
  being the Bank of England; and that
  indigestible dish is flanked by St. James's Palace.
  Then we have the head of Pitt, which is labelled
  &quot;The Roast Beef of Old England,&quot; and served up
  appetizingly on a trencher, etc. Behind the Emperor
  stand his guards with huge uplifted sabres, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> which blood is dripping, while behind the dropsical
  Empress stand her ladies-in-waiting, three female
  ghouls of wondrous hideousness, in dresses so <i>d&eacute;colett&eacute;</i> as to shock persons less nice than Mrs.
  Grundy.</p>
<p>In another example the great Corsican is represented
  as &quot;Teddy Doll, the great French Gingerbread
  Baker, drawing out a new Batch of Kings,&quot;
  while his man, Talleyrand, is making up the dough
  for others. Bonaparte is pictured in uniform, with
  boots and spurs, and a huge cocked-hat with an
  impossible feather, drawing out a batch of newly-made
  kings&mdash;Bavaria, W&uuml;rtemburg, and Baden&mdash;from
  an enormous oven, labelled &quot;New French
  Oven for Imperial Gingerbread.&quot; Beneath the
  oven-door is what is called &quot;an ash-hole for broken
  gingerbread.&quot; Amongst the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> which has been
  swept into the ash-hole by a broom labelled
  &quot;Corsican Besom of Destruction,&quot; Spain, a crowned
  death's head, is prominent; together with Austria,
  Holland, Switzerland, Venice, etc., &quot;all in wild
  destruction blent.&quot; In the background Hanover is
  being destroyed by the Prussian Eagle, as Talleyrand
  is busy kneading up the dough to be presently
  passed from &quot;the Political Kneading-Trough,&quot; to
  reappear in the shape of gingerbread kings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> Poland, Turkey, and Hungary, after the manipulation
  of the King-maker and a visit to the French
  oven.</p>
<p>There is much grim humour in this piece, and
  humour as well as a deeper meaning in the parody
  of &quot;Belshazzar's Feast&quot;; but, turning from such work
  and the thoughts that arise from it to that of Leech
  is like turning from a slaughter-house to a flower-garden,
  from ugliness to beauty.</p>
<p>From the time of Gillray to that of Leech, there
  is little to be said of the caricaturists, with one
  splendid exception, &quot;Immortal George.&quot; I do not
  agree with those who place Cruikshank above
  Leech. Cruikshank was essentially a caricaturist;
  Leech was not. Comparisons, as Mrs. Malaprop
  says, are &quot;odorous,&quot; but we are sometimes forced
  into them; and, while admitting that there were
  certain paths&mdash;heights, perhaps&mdash;which Cruikshank
  ascended with honour, and on which Leech could
  not have found foothold, there was a highroad,
  bordered by beautiful things, on which he would
  have easily distanced his formidable rival.</p>
<p>In my young days the political drawings of &quot;H. B.,&quot;
  the father of Richard Doyle, were much esteemed
  and in great request. They dealt solely with the
  political events of the hour, and, though feebly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> drawn and ineffective as works of art, the designer
  managed to produce unmistakable likenesses of
  Sir Robert Peel, the Duke of Wellington, <i>et hoc
  genus</i>, with remarkable certainty, and always without
  a trace of caricature.</p>

<h3>KENNY MEADOWS.</h3>
<p>The reader has only to look at the early numbers
  of <i>Punch</i> to see how inferior were the drawings compared
  to Leech's work, or to that of the excellent
  artists now at work on <i>Punch</i>. Kenny Meadows
  was perhaps the best; indeed, he was a fellow of
  excellent fancy, quaintly humorous at times&mdash;seen, I
  think, at his best in his Shakespeare illustrations;
  which, in spite of some extravagance, are full of
  character, and, as in the &quot;Midsummer Night's
  Dream,&quot; almost poetical in their realization of the
  scenes of that immortal play. But Kenny was a
  sad Bohemian, a jovial soul, loving company and
  the refreshments that attend it, in which he indulged
  in happy forgetfulness till &quot;all but he departed.&quot;</p>
<p>In illustration of Kenny's habits, I introduce a
  little story told to me by himself. Long years ago
  Mr. Carter Hall edited a book of British ballads,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> and engaged a number of artists to illustrate them;
  Kenny Meadows amongst the rest. I also had the
  honour of supplying a contribution. When the
  drawings were finished, we were invited one evening
  to the Rosery&mdash;as Mr. Hall called his Brompton
  cottage&mdash;to submit our work for his criticism, and
  approval or condemnation, as the case might be.
  Our refreshment was coffee and biscuits, a repast
  very unsatisfactory to all of us, more or less&mdash;to
  Meadows especially. Kenny bore his disappointment
  very well till we left the Rosery&mdash;this we did
  at the earliest moment consistent with good manners&mdash;when
  he said, after criticising our entertainment
  in strong language:</p>
<p>&quot;There is a house close by where we can get
  supper. What do you fellows say?&quot;</p>
<p>We all said &quot;that was the place for us.&quot;</p>
<p>Under Meadows' guidance, we found an inn and
  an excellent supper, and about midnight, when the
  fun was getting fast and furious, I left; Meadows
  remaining with two or three other choice spirits&mdash;how
  long I only knew when I met him a few days
  afterwards. The time of his return home may be
  guessed by what follows. Day was breaking as
  Meadows stealthily entered his bedroom, almost
  praying that Mrs. Meadows might be asleep; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> that lady awoke, and, catching sight of her husband,
  said:</p>
<p>&quot;You are very late, Meadows.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no,&quot; said Meadows, &quot;I am not; it's quite
  early.&quot;</p>
<p>(&quot;So it was, you know,&quot; said the Bohemian to
  me, as he told me of his reception.)</p>
<p>&quot;Early!&quot; exclaimed the wife. &quot;Why, what
  o'clock is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, about one, or a little after,&quot; said Kenny.</p>
<p>Unluckily, at that moment the peculiar but unmistakable
  cry of the milkman was heard&mdash;&quot;and
  that pretty well settled the time, you know, Frith.&quot;</p>

<h3>&quot;COMIC HISTORY OF ROME.&quot;</h3>
<p>The extreme difficulty&mdash;in some instances the
  impossibility&mdash;of procuring copies of some of the
  books illustrated by Leech makes exact chronological
  sequence impossible in any attempt to describe
  the career of the artist. I hope to be pardoned,
  therefore, for the irregularity of my dates.</p>
<p>In 1852 a &quot;Comic History of Rome&quot; appeared,
  written by Gilbert &agrave; Beckett, with &quot;ten coloured
  etchings and numerous woodcuts by Leech.&quot; Rome
  fares pretty much the same as England at the hands
  of both writer and illustrator. In Mr. &Agrave; Beckett's
  part of the work the history of Rome becomes a
  very comic history indeed, and Leech, of course,
  enters into the spirit of the fun with all his
  exuberance of fancy and irresistible humour. Visitors
  to the National Gallery, should they be curious to
  see the difference of treatment of the same subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> by different minds, can be gratified by comparing
  Rubens' &quot;Rape of the Sabines&quot; with Leech's rendering
  of that famous historical event.</p>
<p>In one particular the illustration of the scene is
  identical in both pictures. Rubens dresses the
  ladies in the costume peculiar to his own time;
  Leech in the time of Queen Victoria. In the great
  Fleming's work the principal victim of the Roman
  youth is the wife of the painter, in the dress of
  Rubens' day; in Leech's drawing, strange to say,
  we have an excellent likeness of Mrs. Leech, as
  she sits complacently on the shoulders of a Roman
  youth. Rubens, however, pays more attention to
  truth in the habiliments of his ravishers, for if they,
  in all probability, did not much resemble Roman
  soldiers in their habits as they lived, they present
  a tolerable resemblance to the ancient Roman as we
  know him. Whereas Leech&mdash;while preserving
  something like the form of the upper part of the
  Roman costume&mdash;cannot be said to be correct when
  he puts Hessian boots upon one man, hunting-tops
  upon another, and consigns the nether portion of
  a third to the military trousers, boots and spurs of
  the modern Life-Guardsman. Nobody, I think, will
  believe that umbrellas were known to the Romans,
  as Leech would have us to understand, by putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> one as a weapon into the hands of the stout, very
  modern woman belabouring the Roman who is
  carrying off her daughter.</p>
<p>In explanation of the following cut, I may remind
  readers of Roman history that Romulus sent cards
  of invitation to attend certain games to the Latins
  and Sabines, with their wives and daughters.</p>
<p>&quot;The weather being propitious,&quot; says Mr.
  &Agrave; Beckett, &quot;all the Sabine beauty and fashion
  were attracted to the place, and the games, consisting
  of horse-racing, gave to the scene all the
  animation of Ascot on a Cup-day. Suddenly, at a
  preconcerted signal, there was a general elopement
  of the Roman youth with the Sabine ladies, who
  were in the most ungallant manner abandoned to
  their fate by the Sabine gentlemen. It is true the
  latter were taken by surprise, but they certainly
  made the best of their way home before they thought
  of avenging the wrong and insult that had been
  committed. Had they been all married ladies who
  were carried off, the cynic might have suggested
  that the Sabine husbands would not have objected
  to a cheap mode of divorce; but&mdash;to make use of
  an Irishism&mdash;there was only one single woman who
  happened to be a wife in the whole of that goodly
  company.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
<p>An Etruscan ruler named Porsenna had a difficulty
  with Rome. He speedily besieged that city,
  frightening the people in the suburbs &quot;out of their
  wits and into the city, where he never enjoyed a
  moment's peace till peace was concluded.&quot; Presently
  a treaty of peace was negotiated, greatly to the
  advantage of Porsenna; for not only was Rome
  compelled to restore the territory taken from the
  Veii, but the victor also &quot;claimed hostages, among
  whom were sundry young ladies of the principal
  Roman families. One of these was named Cl&aelig;lia,
  who, with other maidens, having resolved on a bold
  plunge for their liberty, jumped into the Tiber's bed,
  and swam like a party of ducks to the other side of
  the river.&quot;</p>
<p>This delightful drawing reminds one of many a
  seaside sketch in &quot;Pictures of Life and Character,&quot;
  leaving us wondering how a few pencil-lines can call
  up such visions of beauty.</p>
<p>Everyone knows of the tradition of Rome's being
  saved from the Gauls by the cackling of geese, and
  my readers are here presented with Leech's historical
  picture of the event.</p>

 width="413" height="500" alt="" /> <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Rome Saved from the Gauls by Geese.</span></span></div>
<p>&quot;The Gauls,&quot; says Mr. &Agrave; Beckett, &quot;crept up,
  one by one, to the top of the rock, which was the
  summit of their wishes. Just as they had effected their object, a wakeful goose commenced a vehement
  cackle, and the solo of one old bird was soon followed
  by a chorus from a score of others. Marcus Manlius,
  who resided near the poultry, was so alarmed at the
  sound that he instantly jumped out of his skin&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> in those days a sheep-skin was the usual bedding&mdash;and
  ran to the spot, where he caught hold of the
  first Gaul he came to, and, giving him a smart push,
  the whole pack behind fell like so many cards to the
  bottom.&quot;</p>

<h3>PERSONAL ANECDOTES.</h3>
<p>The late Frederick Tayler, whose water-colour
  drawings are familiar to all lovers of art, was a
  guest for some days at the mansion of the Duke
  of Athole&mdash;an elderly gentleman thirty years ago,
  but how nearly connected with the present Duke
  I am unable to say. According to Tayler, the old
  Duke was a very eccentric person; one of his whims
  being an insistence upon all the male guests at his
  castle wearing the Scottish national dress. On my
  friend's pleading that he could not wear a costume
  that he didn't possess, he was supplied with the kilt
  and the rest of it, from a store kept for unprovided
  visitors&mdash;&quot;and,&quot; said Tayler, &quot;I was immediately
  compelled to ride about eighteen miles in a condition
  of discomfort that may be imagined.&quot; Another
  little peculiarity was scarcely less distressing, for
  dinner was never served till near midnight. Hungry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> guests were kept waiting till, folding-doors being
  thrown open, the major-domo appeared, holding a
  wand, and in solemn tones announced &quot;His Grace!&quot;</p>
<p>In 1850 this remarkable Duke &quot;took it into his
  head&quot; to close his beautiful Glen Tilt to tourists.
  I was fortunate enough to have passed through it
  before this decree was issued; but multitudes&mdash;noisy
  multitudes, as they proved themselves&mdash;not
  having had my advantage, became clamorous for
  their right, as they believed, of unobstructed passage
  through the lovely glen. Many letters from indignant
  tourists appeared in the press, which almost universally
  condemned the Duke's action, <i>Punch's</i> baton
  being brought into play in the tourists' cause; and
  to this weapon was added Leech's pencil, which, in
  a vigorous drawing, portrayed the old Duke as a
  dog in the manger, with a snarl on his face that
  portended a bite if his position was assailed. The
  drawing was entitled &quot;A Scotch Dog in the Manger,&quot;
  and was immediately followed by another blow,
  happily paraphrasing Scott's lines in the &quot;Lady
  of the Lake,&quot; and supposed to apply to &quot;a scene
  from the burlesque recently performed at Glen
  Tilt&quot;:</p>
<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&quot;These are Clan Athole's warriors true,<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">And, Saxons, I'm the regular Doo.&quot;<br />
    </span> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></div>
</div>
<p>How far these drawings were the means of causing
  the Duke to reverse his decision I know not; but
  it was reversed, and that he took Leech's somewhat
  severe treatment good-humouredly is shown by his
  treatment of the artist, whom he met near the glen
  soon after the drawings appeared. Leech was alone,
  sketch-book in hand, no doubt noting, by pencil and
  observation, for future use, some of the beauties
  around him, when a horseman approached, attended
  by a groom. Leech was probably on forbidden
  ground, for the rider, who was the Duke of Athole,
  immediately asked his name and &quot;what he was
  doing there.&quot; Under ordinary circumstances Leech
  would have said, &quot;What is <i>your</i> name?&quot; for the
  matter of that, &quot;and what do you want to do with
  mine if I give it to you?&quot;; but whether the manner
  of his questioner impressed him, or conscious guilt
  shook him, I cannot say. It is certain, however,
  that he replied he was an artist, and that his name
  was Leech.</p>
<p>&quot;Not John Leech?&quot; said the Duke.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, John,&quot; was the reply.</p>
<p>And Leech now, feeling sure that he was in the
  presence of the Duke, and that he was about to hear
  some strong language about his daring to caricature
  so august a personage for merely asserting his rights,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> proceeded to explain that he would not intrude
  further, but return at once to his inn, where he
  intended to pass the night.</p>
<p>The Duke turned to his groom, and told him to dismount,
  and called to Leech to take the servant's place.</p>
<p>Leech obeyed, when the Duke said, &quot;No, sir; no
  inn for you to-night: you must dine and sleep at my
  house. I am the Duke of Athole.&quot; Further hesitation
  on Leech's part was met by a warmer and more
  pressing invitation.</p>
<p>Leech yielded, and the two rode off together.
  The road to the castle lay through some rather
  perilous country, culminating in a narrow and
  broken path, with cliff on one side and a precipice
  on the other. The artist hesitated; the Duke called
  upon him to come on. &quot;Has he brought me here
  to revenge himself by breaking my neck?&quot; thought
  Leech. He timidly advanced, and reached the Duke,
  who had stopped for him at a point where the path
  was most dangerous.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you, sir, the man who has maligned me in <i>Punch</i>?&quot; fiercely demanded the Duke.</p>
<p>The fearful position in which Leech found himself,
  terrible to anyone, but to a nervous man especially
  frightful, extorted from him an apologetic confession,
  excusable under the circumstances.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>
<p>&quot;Your Grace,&quot; said he, &quot;we&mdash;we&mdash;that is, nearly
  everyone&mdash;has done something that he&mdash;he&mdash;regrets
  having done. I am very sorry I have&mdash;&mdash; I regret
  very much that anything I have done should
  have given you any annoyance.&quot;</p>
<p>The Duke's affected fierceness was exchanged for
  the jovial manner said to be peculiar to him, and the
  pair rode off pleasantly together.</p>
<p>The castle was reached, and Leech was shown to
  a dressing-room, where he made himself as presentable
  as he could under the circumstances, in anticipation
  of the usual announcement that dinner was
  served. I can imagine my friend's feelings as he
  waited in hungry expectation. &quot;As he could not
  manage to break my neck,&quot; thought Leech, as hour
  after hour passed without a summons to dinner, &quot;he
  means to starve me.&quot;</p>
<p>At last, thinking that perhaps his room was too
  far off for the sound of the gong to reach him, he
  rang the bell. A servant appeared.</p>
<p>&quot;I am afraid,&quot; said Leech, &quot;that I did not hear
  the dinner-bell; is dinner ready?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not yet, sir; you will be informed when it
  is.&quot;</p>
<p>Another hour passed. Leech became desperate;
  starvation seemed to stare him in the face. Again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> he rang the bell; again the servant answered it, and
  the reply was again, &quot;Not yet.&quot;</p>
<p>The clock had struck ten before the welcome
  sound of the gong reached the famished man. If
  Mr. Frederick Tayler is to be believed, the Leech
  dinner with the Duke was an <i>early</i> one. No explanation
  was ever given to Tayler of these
  abnormal dinner-hours, but Leech was told that
  &quot;his Grace&quot; always took a nap after his rides, and
  his guests were fed when he awoke.</p>
<p>Leech was fond of telling of this adventure with
  the Duke, whose likeness can be seen in more than
  one of Landseer's pictures.</p>

<h3>PERSONAL ANECDOTES (<i>continued</i>).</h3>
<p>At the time when the troop of artists and literary
  men were stumping the country with their theatrical
  performances, Leech lived in Alfred Place, which he
  soon left for a charming little house in Notting Hill
  Terrace.</p>
<p>Dickens wrote an amusing account of one of the
  amateur excursions, which the immortal Mrs. Gamp
  is supposed to join, and about which she discourses
  to her friend Mrs. Harris, not forgetting her opinion
  of the artists, Cruikshank and Leech:</p>
<p>&quot;If you'll believe me, Mrs. Harris, I turns my
  head, and sees the very man&quot; (George Cruikshank)
  &quot;a-making pictures of me on his thumb-nail at the
  window; while another of 'em&quot; (John Leech), &quot;a
  tall, slim, melancolly gent, with dark hair and a
  bage voice, looks over his shoulder, and with his
  head o' one side, as if he understood the subject,
  and coolly he says:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>
<p>&quot;'I've drawed her several times in <i>Punch</i>,' he
  says, too. The owdacious wretch!</p>
<p>&quot;'Which I never touches, Mr. Wilson,' I says
  out loud&mdash;I couldn't have helped it, Mrs. Harris, if
  you'd took my life for it&mdash;'which I never touches,
  Mr. Wilson, on account of the lemon!'&quot;</p>
<p>From the nature of Leech's work, he was never
  able to take a holiday in the true sense of the word.
  To say nothing of the numberless works which he
  had engaged himself to illustrate, the inevitable <i>Punch</i> must appear every week, and almost equally
  inevitable was the appearance of one or two of
  Leech's drawings in it. Proof is abundant of the
  rapidity with which those inimitable works were
  executed; but it must be borne in mind that they
  were the outcome of a sensitive organization&mdash;a
  power of seeing and seizing the humorous and the
  beautiful in the everyday incidents of life; in short,
  of a mind always on the watch for subjects for illustration.</p>
<p>When one thinks of the constant wear and tear
  of such a life, it is scarcely a matter for wonder that
  it was so lamentably short.</p>
<p>The localities of Leech's so-called holidays can
  easily be recognised by his drawings, or rather by
  their backgrounds, which showed, in admirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> truthfulness, whether the artist was at Scarborough
  or Broadstairs, at Folkestone, Dover, Lowestoft, or
  Ramsgate, or, by their unfamiliarity to us, at some
  less frequented place.</p>
<p>It was in 1848, and while Mr. and Mrs. Leech
  were staying with the Dickens family at Brighton,
  that a very unpleasant incident of the visit took
  place: no less than the sudden insanity of the landlord
  of the house in which the party lodged, resulting
  in as sudden an exeunt of the lodgers. But before
  the people still in their senses could take themselves
  off, there was a duty to be done. A doctor must be
  fetched; and no sooner did he appear than the madman
  attacked him, and would very soon have made
  a vacancy in the list of M.D.'s if Dickens and Leech
  had not rushed to the rescue. In a letter to Forster,
  Dickens gives a humorous description of Mrs. Leech
  and Mrs. Dickens doing their best&mdash;in their fear for
  their husbands' safety&mdash;to assist the maniac in his
  murderous endeavours by pulling their husbands
  back just as the doctor had fainted from fear. More
  assistance, however, arrived, and the mad landlord
  was soon rendered harmless.</p>
<p>I vividly recollect the alarm that the news of an
  accident to Leech&mdash;in which it was rumoured that he
  had been seriously, even dangerously, injured&mdash;caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> to everyone, and acutely to his friends. A huge
  wave was said to have struck him while bathing&mdash;killing
  him on the spot, according to some reports;
  fracturing his skull, or producing concussion of the
  brain, from which recovery was hopeless, according
  to others. These alarming accounts came to us
  from the Isle of Wight, where Leech was staying
  with Dickens in the autumn of 1849. The fact
  was, that one of the tremendous waves that, under
  certain atmospheric conditions, roll in upon the
  shore at Bonchurch, struck Leech on the forehead,
  and rendered him senseless.</p>
<p>&quot;He was put to bed,&quot; said Dickens, &quot;with twenty
  of his namesakes upon his temples.&quot;</p>
<p>The day following, congestion of the brain became
  unmistakable, accompanied by great pain;
  ice was applied to the head, and bleeding again was
  thought necessary, this time in the arm. For some
  days Leech was in great danger, Dickens sitting up
  with him all night on more than one alarming occasion.
  He says, in a letter to Forster:</p>
<p>&quot;My plans are all unsettled by Leech's illness, as
  of course I do not like to leave this place so long as
  I can be of any service to him and his good little
  wife. Ever since I wrote to you he has been
  seriously worse, and again very heavily bled. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> night before last he was in such an alarming state of
  restlessness, which nothing could relieve, that I proposed
  to Mrs. Leech to try magnetism. Accordingly,
  in the middle of the night, I fell to, and,
  after a very fatiguing bout of it, put him to sleep
  for an hour and thirty-five minutes. A change
  came on in his sleep, and he is decidedly better.
  I talked to the astounded Mrs. Leech across him,
  when he was asleep, as if he had been a truss of
  hay.&quot;</p>
<p>Whether from Dickens' magnetic efforts or the
  efforts of Nature, Leech gradually, but very slowly,
  recovered. On being questioned about his accident,
  Leech is reported to have said that he remembered
  an enormous angry, white-topped wave coming at
  him, and, in what seemed to him the next moment,
  he found himself in bed in great pain&mdash;the interval
  having been some days.</p>
<p>In corroboration of this, I may mention an accident
  that happened to Mr. Elmore (brother of the
  R.A. and great friend of Leech), who was terribly
  injured by a blow on the head in a railway accident
  on the Marseilles line.</p>
<p>&quot;I was reading a novel,&quot; said Mr. Elmore to me,
  &quot;and the next instant, as it seemed, I found myself
  suffering great pain in a strange bed, with strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> surroundings, in what I afterwards found was a
  French cottage.&quot;</p>
<p>The sufferer also found that more than three
  weeks had elapsed between the blow and the recovery
  of consciousness from it. Where, in my
  blind ignorance I venture to ask, was the ever-living
  soul all this time?</p>
<p>One of the amusements of the visitors at Folkestone
  consists in watching the arrival of the French
  packet; and I have noticed that the more stormy
  the day, the greater is the crowd that forms itself
  into an avenue, through which the voyagers must
  pass in landing. This amusement, I think, is not
  very creditable to us, because it is derived from an
  enjoyment arising from the sufferings of our fellow-creatures.
  The rosy passenger, who is evidently
  &quot;a good sailor,&quot; attracts no attention&mdash;we rather
  resent his condition as inappropriate to the occasion;
  but the man from whose face every vestige
  of colour has flown, whose legs can scarcely support
  him as he walks up the gangway, is an object of
  great delight to us. We are generally&mdash;not always&mdash;silent
  in our enjoyment, scarcely ever receiving a
  poor sea-sick creature as Leech was once welcomed
  at Boulogne.</p>
<p>In 1854, Leech and his wife went to Boulogne to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> stay with Dickens. The day was stormy, and when
  the artist stepped ashore, he was received with
  cheers by a crowd of people, mostly English, who
  loudly congratulated him as looking more intensely
  miserable than any of the wretched passengers
  who had preceded him. Leech told Dickens that
  he had realized at last what an actor's feelings must
  be when a round of applause greets his efforts.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt,&quot; he said, &quot;that I had made a great hit.&quot;</p>
<p>My intimacy with Leech led to the usual exchange
  of hospitalities. I recall with pleasure the
  occasions on which I had the great delight of welcoming
  him at my house in London or at the seaside.
  He never varied from the simple, modest
  demeanour of the perfect gentleman, was never noisy
  or argumentative, and always considerate of the feelings
  of others; prodigal in his praise of his brother
  artists; never, if he could avoid it, speaking of
  himself or his works, but if, in course of conversation,
  allusion had been made to some cut more than
  commonly attractive, he would meet it with: &quot;Glad
  you like it, my dear fellow; don't see anything particularly
  funny in it myself;&quot; or, &quot;Ah! I wish you
  could have seen it on the wood; they seem to me
  to have cut all the prettiness out of the girl's face.&quot;</p>
<p>The first time I dined with Leech was at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> house in Notting Hill Terrace, on the occasion of
  some Highland sports that took place in Lord Holland's
  park hard by, out of which Leech made some
  capital sketches, that afterwards appeared in <i>Punch</i>.
  Leech's dinners, without being too lavish or extravagant,
  were always unexceptionable as to food, and
  notably so as to wine; of the latter, being no judge
  himself, he took care it should be supplied by &quot;one
  who knew,&quot; and who was also reliable. One of the
  guests at this particular dinner was the Rev. Mr.
  White, whose acquaintance our host had made at
  the Isle of Wight. I mention this gentleman because
  he was not only a very jovial clergyman, but
  a great friend of Leech and Dickens, and the author
  of some plays which had more or less success&mdash;one
  of them, with the title of &quot;The King of the Commons,&quot;
  was played under Phelps' management, and
  had a considerable run.</p>
<p>&quot;White,&quot; Leech whispered to me, &quot;is a great
  judge of port. I hope to goodness he will like some
  I have got on purpose for him&mdash;and for you, my
  boy; only you know nothing about it, do you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not a bit,&quot; said I.</p>
<p>When the port appeared we watched the clergyman,
  and, judging by his expression, the port was
  successful; but Leech was not satisfied till in reply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> to his inquiry as to its qualities the clergyman,
  smacking his lips, said:</p>
<p>&quot;Sir, the Church approves.&quot;</p>
<p>At one of the delightful dinners at Leech's double-windowed
  house&mdash;double-windowed to keep out noise,
  which distressed him all his life&mdash;on the Terrace,
  Kensington, I first met Shirley Brooks, thus commencing
  a life-long friendship with one of the most
  charming companions, one of the wittiest men and
  the best story-tellers that ever made &quot;the hours go
  by on rosy wing.&quot; One of the strongest men on
  the <i>Punch</i> staff&mdash;afterwards editor&mdash;Brooks and
  Leech became somewhat intimate, but whether the
  intimacy ever became merged into close friendship,
  I doubt. I frequently dined at Brooks's, but never
  met Leech there&mdash;indeed, from what I have heard,
  I am pretty sure that, with the exception of his old
  fellow-student, Percival Leigh, who was one of his
  nearest and dearest friends, Leech's feeling towards
  his brother members of the <i>Punch</i> staff never reached
  friendship in the true meaning of the word. Albert
  Smith, of whose entertainments Leech said one of
  the severest things I or anyone ever heard him
  say&mdash;&quot;After all, Frith, it is only bad John Parry&quot;&mdash;was
  a loud, and, to me, a rather vulgar person&mdash;too
  antagonistic to the gentle Leech for the growth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> friendship. At the <i>Punch</i> meetings, however, I
  have it from one who was occasionally present, that
  Albert Smith always addressed Leech as &quot;Jack,&quot;
  being the only one of the company who used the
  familiarity. This provoked Douglas Jerrold, who
  had often winced under the infliction, to ask Leech
  one day, &quot;How long is it necessary for a man to
  know you before he can call you 'Jack'?&quot;</p>
<p>After this remark &quot;Jack&quot; was less frequently
  heard. My authority for the above is the late
  Mr. George Hodder, an author who I fear has
  left no &quot;footprints in the sands of time.&quot; It was
  said of him that, on being introduced to a very
  distinguished artist, he remarked&mdash;perhaps feeling
  the necessity of making a complimentary speech&mdash;&quot;Art
  is a grand thing, sir.&quot; This unfortunate
  gentleman died from injuries received by the upsetting
  of a coach in Richmond Park.</p>
<p>It is not at all uncommon for middle-class entertainers&mdash;though
  they may possess a fair staff of servants&mdash;to
  seek outside assistance when they gather
  an unusual number of guests round their hospitable
  boards. On one occasion&mdash;and very likely oftener&mdash;Leech
  sought such supplementary aid, and found it
  in the form of his parish clerk, a solemn person who
  was not too proud to add to his stipend by &quot;going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> out to wait.&quot; As is usual with his class, the clerk-waiter
  arrived in good time to help in furnishing
  forth the dinner-table, having an eye to the placing
  of the flowers, plate, etc. The guests, amounting
  to ten or twelve, were announced in due course, all
  old acquaintances, and all expecting their dinners
  with the punctuality for which their host was noted.
  Hungry men, though they may be good talkers
  under happier circumstances, are seldom brilliant; on
  this occasion, though Dickens and Jerrold may have
  been amongst the guests, the conversation languished
  at last into silence. Half an hour passed. What
  could have happened? Suddenly one of the guests&mdash;was
  it Dickens or Jerrold?&mdash;sprang from his chair,
  and going to Leech, with extended hand, said:</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it's getting late; I'm afraid I must go.
  Thank you, dear boy, for a delightful evening; the
  dinner was capital, the turtle first rate&mdash;never tasted
  finer salmon; and as to the champagne&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>The puzzled looks of Leech and his guests ended
  in a roar of laughter, in the midst of which a black
  and solemn figure appeared, and in the tones in which
  he would have given the responses at church, said:</p>
<p>&quot;Dinner is served.&quot;</p>
<p>The assembled guests received the welcome
  announcement with a chorus of &quot;<span class="smcap">Amen</span>!&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>
<h3>SPORTING NOVELS.</h3>
<p>Amongst the many books illustrated by Leech
  are some sporting novels, written, I think, by a
  Mr. Surtees. &quot;Ask Mamma,&quot; &quot;Handley Cross,&quot;
  &quot;Plain or Ringlets,&quot; &quot;Mr. Romford's Hounds,&quot;
  etc., owe their origin to this prolific gentleman.
  As these works are ornamented by coloured steel
  engravings and innumerable woodcuts by Leech, it
  has been my duty to look into them; read them, I
  cannot. I hope if the author is still living he will
  attribute my want of appreciation to a want of
  sympathy with his heroes and heroines, though I
  admit, in the portions I have read, that he shows
  considerable humour as well as power in expressing
  it. This, from one who knows his own ignorance
  of the subject in question, should be gratifying to
  Mr. Surtees.</p>
<p>Though to my mind Leech is quite at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> best in &quot;Pictures of Life and Character,&quot; there are
  examples of his powers in all these books which
  quite justify my selection of some of them for the
  gratification of my readers. &quot;Mr. Romford's
  Hounds&quot; is &quot;embellished&quot; with twenty-five large
  steel plates, in one of which a certain Mr. Facey,
  who has a charming Miss Lucy for his hunting
  companion, is checked by an obstacle which causes
  him to exclaim to Lucy, &quot;Dash it! this is a rum
  customer,&quot; &quot;as he stood in his stirrups, looking at
  what was on the far side.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, throw your heart over it,&quot; said Lucy, &quot;and
  then follow it as quickly as you can.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Heart!&quot; muttered Facey. &quot;I shall never find it
  again if I do. It would be like looking for a needle
  in a bundle of hay.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let <i>me</i> try, then,&quot; said Lucy.</p>
<p>It would be difficult indeed to surpass the beauty
  of the girl's figure in this drawing, exquisitely
  drawn, true in character and action as it is.
  Mr. Facey's expression, too, exactly conveys the
  idea that the longer he looks at the awkward place
  the less he likes it. The horses&mdash;notably the action
  of the one ridden by the young lady&mdash;are in every
  way admirable. The background, with a few slight
  touches, gives us a stretch of country&mdash;a withered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> tree, a flock of birds, and the cloudy sky, with
  no doubt the southerly wind that &quot;proclaims the
  hunting morning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Romford's Hounds&quot; gives us another
  sportsman, who rejoices in the name of Muffington.
  This gentleman is possessed for the moment of a
  horse called, or, rather, miscalled, Placid Joe,
  whose former name, Pull Devil, seems better-suited
  to his propensities, as shown in the drawing,
  in which Placid Joe has taken the bit between his
  teeth, to the discomfiture of Mr. Muffington. From
  the following telegram it would seem that Placid
  Joe had been borrowed for the day's hunting. Thus
  it ran:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Mr. Martin Muffington, at the White Swan,
    Showoffborough, to Mr. Green, Brown Street,
    Bagnigge Wells Road, London.</p>
  <p>&quot;That brute Placid Joe has no more mouth than
    a bull. He's carried me right into the midst of the
    hounds, and nearly annihilated the huntsman. I
    will send him back by the 9.30 a.m. train to-morrow,
    and won't pay you a halfpenny for his hire.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The character of Mr. Muffington, together with
  his action as he tugs in vain at Placid Joe, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> admirable; but the horse, good as it is in action,
  appears to me less well proportioned than Leech's
  horses almost invariably are, the head and neck
  being too small. But what could surpass the huntsman
  and his steed just recovering from the &quot;cannoning&quot;
  received from Placid Joe? The scattered
  hounds, the riders behind, and the landscape leave
  nothing to be desired.</p>
<p>&quot;Plain or Ringlets&quot; contains twelve coloured
  plates and no less than forty-three woodcuts. Judging
  from a slight acquaintance with the letterpress
  and a careful study of the illustrations in this book,
  I find that the author deals less exclusively with
  the feats of the hunter than in &quot;Mr. Romford's
  Hounds&quot;; shooting, racing, etc., are allowed to
  figure prominently, and the pursuit of &quot;lovely
  woman&quot;&mdash;in which there seem to be as many false
  scents and heavy falls as beset the chasing of the
  fox&mdash;plays an important part in &quot;Plain or Ringlets.&quot;
  Unlike the policeman's, I have often thought that
  the riding-master's life must &quot;be a happy one.&quot; I
  am borne out in this, I think, by the illustration,
  in which Leech is delightfully at home. Says our
  author:</p>
<p>&quot;Smiling, cantering bevies of beauties, with their
  shining hair in gold or silver beaded nets, and party-coloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> feathers in their jaunty little hats, alone
  imparted energy to the scene as they tit-tupped along
  with quickly following tramp, led by the most magnificent
  and affable of riding-masters, who thus
  advertise their studs, just as Howes and Cushing
  advertise their grand United States Circus. Bless
  us, what a pace some of them go!&quot;</p>
<p>What life and motion there are in this group!
  How is it, by what occult influence do we find those
  two lovely creatures right and left of the riding-master,
  instead of one place of honour being
  reserved for the stout middle-aged lady, who, strange
  to say, seems quite contented with her position? I
  don't believe those two girls want any teaching, for
  do they not sit their horses with perfect grace, as
  safely at home in their saddles as they would be in
  one of the lounges in their drawing-rooms, which
  either of them would fill so charmingly? Look
  what pretty creatures the magician Leech can call up
  for us by a few scratches of his pencil, in the rear of
  this cantering procession!</p>
<p>The Duke of Tergiversation (Ph&#339;bus, what
  a name!), says the author of &quot;Plain or Ringlets,&quot;
  found on inheriting his estate that &quot;the life had been
  eaten out of it&quot; before the death of his father put
  him in possession of his ancestral property.  The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> Duke, however, seems to have made the acquaintance
  of a banker, named Goldspink, who yielded to
  his persuasions and promises to the extent of allowing
  his aristocratic customer to overdraw his account
  to such a formidable amount as seriously to imperil
  the stability of the bank. Mr. Goldspink then
  seeks an interview with his Grace, which the Duke,
  after endeavouring by all sorts of shifts to avoid,
  was at length compelled to grant.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, my dear Mr. Goldspink!&quot; exclaimed the
  Duke, advancing with outstretched hands and all the
  cheerful cordiality imaginable as our &quot;crab-actioned&quot;
  friend followed the smoothly-gliding butler, Mr. Garnett,
  into the presence. &quot;Ah, my dear Goldspink, this
  is indeed most kind and considerate! First neighbour
  that has come to greet us. How, may I ask,
  is your worthy wife and your excellent son?&quot; taking
  both the banker's hands and shaking them severely.</p>
<p>The banker makes a mental calculation of the
  Duke's liabilities, with a clear understanding that
  &quot;his Grace is on the gammon-and-spinach tack,&quot; and
  then says:</p>
<p>&quot;Thank your Grace&mdash;his Grace&mdash;my Grace&mdash;that
  is to say&mdash;they are both pretty well. Hope the
  Duchess and Lord Marchhare&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Duchess and Marchhare are both at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> moment enjoying a quiet cup of tea in her pretty
  little boudoir, where, I am sure, they will be most
  happy to see Mr. Goldspink,&quot; said the Duke, motioning
  him to the gilt-moulded white door opposite.</p>
<p>This cut seems to me to show Leech's power of
  marking the difference of character in the persons
  represented in a degree noticeable by the most
  ordinary observer. The Duke is an aristocrat from
  top to toe; the insincerity of his welcome even is
  apparent; while the squat and &quot;crab-like&quot; figure
  of the banker is no less true to nature; his delight
  at shaking hands with a Duke making him forget
  for the moment the serious issues dependent upon
  the interview.</p>
<p>At the eleventh hour I find myself forbidden to
  show my readers any of the admirable drawings
  which illustrate this book.</p>

<h3>THE &quot;BON GAULTIER BALLADS.&quot;</h3>
<p>I will here leave the sporting novels for a time
  and introduce my reader to the &quot;Bon Gaultier
  Ballads,&quot; and if he make his first acquaintance with
  that work through this introduction, I respectfully
  advise him to improve it by a more intimate knowledge,
  for he will not only find excellent reading,
  but illustrations by Richard Doyle and others,
  scarcely inferior to those by Leech.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that at the time of the Papal
  aggression Lord John Russell, according to Leech,
  chalked &quot;No Popery&quot; on Cardinal Wiseman's door
  and then ran away. In the &quot;Bon Gaultier Ballads&quot;
  we find his lordship face to face with Cardinal
  Wiseman, disguised as a friar, in Sherwood Forest,
  where Little John is supposed to reign in place of
  Robin Hood, deceased. The ballad is entitled
  &quot;Little John and the Red Friar,&quot; and begins:</p>

<p>from his refuge in the tree, to which, according to
  Leech, he has been tossed by the Popish Bull.</p>
<p>Cardinal Wiseman, as I remember him, was a
  huge burly figure, not unlike Leech's drawing; a
  stronger resemblance to Lord John can be traced in
  the swaggering little figure in the first illustration
  and also in the second.</p>
<p>Most of the &quot;Bon Gaultier Ballads&quot; are illustrated
  by Doyle and other hands. Leech's contributions
  are confined to four of them. The next from
  which I select drawings is called &quot;The Rhyme of
  Sir Launcelot Bogle.&quot; It appears that &quot;this valiant
  knight, most terrible in fight,&quot; had married the sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> of another valiant knight named George of Gorbals,
  and with his bride he had retired to his castle near
  Glasgow. For some reason or other this marriage
  was very distasteful to the brother of the bride&mdash;so
  distasteful, indeed, that nothing but the blood of Sir
  Launcelot would wipe out the disgrace. In pursuit
  of his revenge, George of Gorbals armed his followers
  and approached the castle, where</p>

<p>Judging from the angry face of &quot;the lover's

  to be derived from the finest brand to enable him to
  endure his friend's moaning with common patience.
  One studies with wonder and admiration the few
  touches with which the story is told in this little
  drawing. See the handsome frowning face of &quot;the
  lover's friend,&quot; so perfectly in contrast with that of the
  absorbed lover, whose voice can almost be heard
  expatiating on the beauty of the lost one, and the
  hardness of her heart!</p>

<h3>Sporting Novels (<i>continued</i>).</h3>
<p>&quot;Handley Cross&quot; is another of the sporting novels
  so admirably illustrated by Leech. The hero of
  this book is a certain Mr. Jorrocks, a retired &quot;great
  city grocer of the old school.&quot; A fortune gained in
  the grocery business enabled Mr. Jorrocks to retire
  into country life, where the sports of the field
  awaited him. He became a mighty hunter, the
  possessor of the finest horses and &quot;the best pack
  of 'ounds in all the world,&quot; who would make the
  foxes cry &quot;Capevi!&quot; He is M.F.H., and so great
  an authority on sporting matters as to warrant his
  announcing himself as a lecturer on the duties of all
  concerned in the truly British sport of the chasing
  of the fox. Mr. Jorrocks's antecedents were such
  as to preclude the possibility of the display of brilliant
  oratorical powers. His mode of expression&mdash;including
  the absence of the letter &quot;h,&quot; where it should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> be used, and its presence where it should not&mdash;was
  what might have been expected from the
  retired grocer whose little figure adorns the illustration.</p>
<p>Leech's old friend, Mr. Adams, tells me that a
  man named Nicholls, Lady Louise Clinton's coachman,
  was the model for Mr. Jorrocks. Leech never
  went anywhere, not even to church, without his
  little sketch-book; and on a special Sunday at
  Barkway Church, where Lady Clinton had her pew,
  she was followed by a little man who, after handing
  her ladyship her books of devotion, took his seat
  outside the pew, and became an unconscious study
  for Leech; who in a few minutes transferred an
  exact likeness to the sketch-book, which was afterwards
  as exactly reproduced in the &quot;hunting lecture.&quot;</p>
<p>A curious reader can study Mr. Jorrocks's lecture
  in the pages of &quot;Handley Cross.&quot; He will there
  wonder with me how it came about, that so distinguished
  an audience of aristocratic men, and lovely
  women, could listen for many minutes to an oration
  which must have lasted at least two hours, and
  which ends with the following peroration: &quot;So
  shall little Spooney jog on rejoicin'! Each succeedin'
  year shall find him better mounted, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> each fresh deal he will become a wiser and I 'opes a
  nappier man.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Jorrocks concluded amidst loud and universal
  applause.</p>
<p>Leech's mastery of character&mdash;unexaggerated, true
  to nature, without a trace of caricature&mdash;can be seen
  in the foreground figures of this etching. The man
  standing behind the lady with the lovely profile is
  a gentleman, though perhaps not a wise one; but
  what can the beautiful profile find in Mr. Jorrocks's
  discourse to amuse or enlighten her? And those
  pretty creatures in the distance, who certainly seem
  a little bored, how is it that they did not slip away
  with their cavaliers behind them, and so leave Mr.
  Jorrocks to talk about 'unting to 'is 'eart's content?</p>
<p>One of Mr. Jorrocks's sporting friends is Mr.
  Charley Stobbs, a good-looking young gentleman
  who finds himself belated after a hard day's hunting.
  He wanders about an unknown country, darkness
  comes upon him, and he endeavours in vain to find
  his way to Handley Cross. &quot;The night was drear
  and dark, the wind whistled and howled with uncommon
  keenness, the cutting hail drifted with the
  sharpness of needles against his face. Horse and
  rider were equally dispirited,&quot; says the chronicler.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> This free and easy, or, rather uneasy, fox-hunter,
  determined to seek shelter for the night at the first
  house he came to, that promised from its appearance
  a comfortable bed, with, perhaps, an introductory
  supper. He soon found himself &quot;under the
  lee of a large house, and having dismounted, and
  broken his shins against a scraper, he at length
  discovered a bell-pull in the door-post, which having
  sounded, the echoing notes from afar proclaimed the
  size and importance of the mansion.&quot; &quot;A little
  maiden&quot; gave Charley admission, and, with surprising
  alacrity, provided him with &quot;ham sandwiches,
  hot water, lemon, nutmeg,&quot; etc., to say
  nothing of a bottle of sherry!</p>
<p>To the common mind the ease with which Mr.
  Charles Stobbs managed to procure for himself a
  supper and lodging in a stranger's mansion will be
  a matter of surprise; in ninety-nine cases out of a
  hundred he would have met with a very different
  reception. We rejoice in his success, because it
  gives us a likeness of his good-looking self, in
  conjunction with that of one of the prettiest and
  daintiest waiting-maids ever created by Leech's
  pencil.</p>
<p>Had I been permitted I should have selected
  a drawing from &quot;Handley Cross,&quot; which heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> a chapter called &quot;The Waning Season,&quot; not
  from its subject (which has little interest), but
  because it is an admirable example of Leech's
  mastery of landscape. The figure of the old hedger,
  with his big gauntlets and bill-hook, is as true as
  possible to nature, well drawn, and perfect in action,
  as he stoops over the faggots he has collected; but
  I would call more attention to the drawing of the
  foreground and distance of the landscape; the
  stunted tree and the wattled fence in its perspective
  cunningly going off almost to the horizon&mdash;thus
  leading the eye into space&mdash;with its lines so skilfully
  broken by the leafless trees. The sky, too,
  though represented by a few lines, composes artistically
  with the forms in the distance and the rest of
  the wintry landscape.</p>
<p>With &quot;Ask Mamma&quot;&mdash;another of the many
  sporting books illustrated by Leech&mdash;I shall close
  my selections from that kind of literature for the
  present.</p>
<p>In the frontispiece of the book, which represents
  &quot;The Ancestors of our Hero,&quot; the female
  ancestor is such a bewitching creature as to make a
  reproduction of her in this place irresistible. This
  charming person is Mrs. William Pringle, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Willing,
  about whose birth, parentage, and education<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> history is silent. Her acquaintance is first made
  by the reader of &quot;Ask Mamma&quot; in the position of
  assistant in a milliner's shop, which she soon left for
  a shop of her own. In this venture Miss Willing
  failed disastrously, and, leaving dressmaking, she
  became a lady's-maid in the service of &quot;the beautiful,
  newly-married Countess Delacey.&quot; &quot;It was to
  the service of the Countess Delacey,&quot; says our
  author, &quot;that Miss Willing was indebted for becoming
  the wife of Mr. William Pringle.&quot; The
  acquaintance between Miss Willing and Mr. Pringle,
  which soon ripened into love and marriage, began
  on the stage-coach, in which Miss Willing was
  journeying to London to buy dresses for her mistress,
  the Countess. Alas! it must be confessed
  that Miss Willing was an unscrupulous adventuress,
  and Mr. Pringle a very green goose indeed; for
  when he found Miss Willing installed in the Countess's
  house in Grosvenor Square, dressed in her
  mistress's emerald-green velvet costume, he believed
  her to be, as she represented herself, the mistress of
  the mansion. A big footman played into Miss Willing's
  hand, and &quot;my lady'd&quot; her to her heart's
  content, and to the delight of Mr. Pringle, as the
  refreshments were supplied to which the victim had
  been invited.  Under the inspiring influence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> brandy-and-water Mr. Pringle's love grew apace;
  and in reply to the lady's prudent inquiries as to his
  means of keeping her surrounded by the luxury to
  which she had been accustomed, she was assured
  that &quot;she should have everything she wanted: a
  tall footman with good legs, an Arab horse, an
  Erard harp, a royal pianoforte, a silver tea-urn, a
  gold coffee pot, a service of gold, <i>eat gold</i> if she
  liked;&quot; and, as he made this declaration, &quot;he dropped
  upon his salmon-coloured knees, and with his glass
  of brandy in one hand and hers in the other, looked
  imploring up at her&mdash;a beautiful specimen of heavy
  sentimentality.&quot;</p>
<p>As one looks at the comical figure of Mr. Pringle,
  it would be difficult to believe that, even with the
  golden advantages with which he surrounds himself,
  he could be rendered acceptable to the lovely creature
  of Leech's fancy; if a finger could not be put upon
  couples amongst our own acquaintances even more
  strangely contrasted.</p>
<p>With respect to personal appearance, Mr. Pringle
  fares better at Leech's hands in a drawing representing
  a halt in the stage-coach journey to London.
  The passengers have stopped for refreshment. The
  coachman attends for his fee. Mr. Pringle, &quot;who
  was bent upon doing the magnificent, produced a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> large green-and-gold tasselled purse, almost as big
  as a stocking, and drew therefrom a great five-shilling
  piece, which he handed ostentatiously to the
  man, saying: 'For this lady and me,' just as if she
  belonged to him.&quot;</p>
<p>Here Mr. Pringle fairly resembles a good-looking
  buck of sixty years ago, and the coachman might
  have been one of those whom I remember on
  my own first journey to London, with his &quot;Beg
  pardon, sir, I've drove you fifty miles,&quot; when his fee
  was less than he expected. The coat of many capes,
  the red cheeks and redder nose, the action of the
  man as he holds his hat and whip, are all true to life;
  here again without the least exaggeration. In composition,
  light and shade, and general effect, this
  drawing leaves nothing to wish for. The expression
  of Miss Willing, as she looks sideways at her victim,
  should be noted.</p>
<p>Mr. William Pringle did not long enjoy his
  married life, for his only son (the hero of &quot;Ask
  Mamma&quot;) was but a child, when, &quot;after an inordinate
  kidney supper, Mr. Pringle was found dead
  in his chair.&quot;</p>
<p>The widow was very rich, and after educating her
  son regardless of expense, she launched him into
  high life, and somehow or other brought about an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> acquaintance between &quot;Billy&quot; and a sporting nobleman,
  the Earl of Ladythorne. From that time
  &quot;Ask Mamma&quot; becomes a chronicle of sporting
  adventure, with which I shall not trouble my
  reader, beyond the explanation required for the
  understanding of one or two examples of Leech's
  work.</p>
<p>The noble Earl of Ladythorne seems to have
  been a very impressionable personage, in a constant
  state of suffering from &quot;Cupid's shafts&quot;; and though
  for some reason or other he objected to hunting
  ladies, an &quot;equestrian coquette, Miss De Glancey, of
  half the watering-places in England, and some on
  the Continent,&quot; had but to show herself amongst the
  field and the noble lord was again transfixed; this
  time the dart seems to have gone through and
  through the tender heart, only to be released by an
  event which occurred shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>It appears that Miss De Glancey's love of hunting
  was affected, in order to further her designs upon
  the Earl; she really feared and hated it; and though
  on the fatal day, which was destined to extinguish
  her hope of becoming a Countess, she had ridden
  boldly by the Earl through what he calls &quot;a monstrous
  fine run,&quot; she &quot;found no fun in it at all,&quot;
  and was &quot;monstrous glad when it was over.&quot; No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> sooner was the fox despatched, than the sky darkened,
  the lightning flashed, the thunder bellowed,
  and the rain came down in torrents. &quot;Poor Miss
  De Glancey,&quot; says our author, &quot;was ready to sink
  into the earth.&quot;  There was nothing for it but
  to seek the nearest shelter, which seems to have
  been the Punch Bowl at Rockbeer, in search of
  which &quot;my lord&quot; and the coquette ride off together.
  &quot;An opportune flash of lightning so lit up the landscape
  as to show the clump of large elms at the
  entrance to Rockbeer.&quot; The hard driving rain beats
  downways and sideways, frontways and backways&mdash;all
  ways at once. The horses know not which way
  to duck to evade the storm. In less than a minute
  Miss De Glancey is as drenched as if she had taken
  a shower-bath.  &quot;The smart hat and feather are
  annihilated; the dubious frizette falls out; down
  comes the hair; the <i>bella-donna</i>-inspired radiance of
  her eyes is quenched; the crinoline and wadding
  dissolve like ice before the fire; and ere <i>the love-cured
  Earl</i> lifts her off her horse at the Punch Bowl
  at Rockbeer, she has no more shape or figure than
  an icicle. Indeed, she much resembles one, for the
  cold sleet, freezing as it fell, has encrusted her in a
  rich coat of iced lace, causing her saturated garments
  to cling to her with the utmost pertinacity. A more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> complete wreck of a belle was perhaps never
  seen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Brief as woman's love,&quot; says Shakspeare. That
  this remark will sometimes apply to man's love
  cannot be contested, for have we not an example
  before us in the rapid way in which our noble friend's
  passion was, so to speak, washed out of him? The
  love-stricken Earl &quot;cured&quot; by a shower of rain!
  We ought to be thankful for the downpour, for it
  was the cause of Leech's drawing, in which the unfortunate
  coquette is still, under the artist's tender
  treatment, an elegant creature, with grace and
  beauty in every line of her bedraggled form. How
  admirable, too, is the Earl! the rain dripping from
  the brim of his hat, and with every opportunity for
  making him ridiculous, he is still dignified, his face
  and figure noble, as he bends forward to meet the
  storm. It goes without saying that the horses are
  admirable in character and action, and that the whole
  scene exactly realizes a wet and stormy night.</p>

<h3>MICHAEL HALLIDAY AND LEECH.</h3>
<p>&quot;No man can put more into a picture than there
  is in himself,&quot; says Sir Joshua Reynolds. As an
  art student I have always felt the force of this aphorism.
  I would even go further, and add that no man
  can avoid the disclosure in numberless ways of what
  &quot;there is in himself&quot; of special mental organization,
  under the heads of taste, temper, delicacy, honesty,
  kindliness, and the true and full appreciation of the
  beauties of nature.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot see nature as you represent it,&quot; someone
  is said to have remarked to Turner.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't you wish you could?&quot; was the reply.</p>
<p>It is not the subject of a great artist's work that
  we admire, but the artist's mind as reflected in his
  subject. Reynolds was fortunate in having for his
  sitters most of the beauties of the last century, and
  they were more fortunate still in falling into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> hands of a painter who had such intense sympathy
  with their loveliness&mdash;so intense in some instances
  as to emphasize it somewhat to the sacrifice of individuality.
  It is what Turner sees in nature that we
  reverence, producing beauties for us to which we
  were blind, till they were called up by the spell of
  the great magician. Heads as fine as any of those
  painted by Vandyke can be seen any day, but there
  is no Vandyke to show us the impression they make
  upon him. Let anyone compare Vandyke's Charles I.
  with a contemporary rendering of that monarch, and
  he will feel with me that it is the great painter's
  power of penetrating the inner man before him, so
  to speak, added to his sympathy with the melancholy
  and dignified King, that, combined with his transcendent
  technical power, enabled him to present to
  us both the person and the mind of the unfortunate
  King. The contemporary painters give us but the
  husk and shell of him.</p>
<p>But of all artists who have reflected themselves
  in their works, Leech is the best example. Save
  when his hatred of injustice and oppression is
  aroused, the man's loving, tender nature, and his
  honest English, manly character, are apparent in
  everything he does. As he was to all who knew
  him well, he shows himself in his treatment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> every theme he touches with his pencil. Of his
  life&mdash;quiet, studious, and ever observant&mdash;there
  is little to relate that cannot be gathered from his
  works. His passionate love of children and childish
  ways and tricks, his sympathy with beauty in all its
  forms, his eager participation in manly sports, with
  numberless other delightful qualities, are part and
  parcel of the man who was never tired of giving us
  unconscious revelations of himself in his drawings.
  Even when a certain amount of ridicule is attached
  to the principal incidents in the career of a ludicrous
  personage, we never have a feeling for him
  approaching contempt.</p>
<p>In the history of Messrs. Briggs and Tom Noddy
  these gentlemen present themselves in positions of
  laughable difficulty. Laugh at them we certainly
  do, but we never despise them; for do they not show
  the good qualities of courage and fortitude? Tom
  Noddy is thrown from his horse; nothing daunted,
  he instantly remounts. He drops his whip; he recovers
  it: is thrown again, and this time his horse
  gallops off; but though the little hunter pursues as
  fast as his little legs can go, the horse has the best
  of it and escapes. An ordinary being would despair
  and bemoan his loss; not so Tom Noddy, who gives
  up the pursuit for a time, and being no doubt a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> tired, lights a cigar as he sits upon a stile. When
  refreshed by tobacco and repose he resumes his
  horse-chase, and ultimately succeeds in finding the
  animal in the possession of a rustic, who had amused
  himself by nearly galloping him to death. Tom
  Noddy is a delightful little creature; his numerous
  escapades are plentiful in &quot;Pictures of Life and
  Character,&quot; and will be for all time a hearty, healthy
  pleasure to all who study them.</p>
<p>Many attempts were made to betray Leech into
  personality. Subjects were suggested, and offers
  were made to him, by persons who had real or
  imaginary grievances, to place well-known public
  characters in positions ridiculous or contemptible.
  Those attempts would not have been made if the
  proposers had known Leech; such suggestions were
  always rejected, and sometimes in terms very unpleasant
  to their proposers. I was not aware that
  Tom Noddy had a prototype until I was informed
  by my old friend, Mr. Holman Hunt, in a paper of
  Leech reminiscences, originally intended for this
  memoir, that Mike Halliday, a man I knew well
  forty years ago, was the original Tom Noddy.
  Halliday's figure was intended for an ordinary-sized
  man, but when Nature had produced his head and
  shoulders she seemed to have changed her intention,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> and the rest of his figure was that of a diminutive
  form, a full foot shorter altogether than an ordinary
  middle-sized man. When I first became acquainted
  with Halliday he was a clerk in the House of Lords.
  &quot;He then,&quot; says Holman Hunt, &quot;took to poetry, to
  love that never found its earthly close, and to our
  art&mdash;for he found time for all. So well did he
  succeed in picture-making that he once completed
  an oil-painting of two lovers sitting under a ruined
  abbey window, habited in contemporary costume,
  the gentleman intent on taking the size of the lady's
  marriage-finger.&quot;</p>
<p>I remember this picture being exhibited at the
  Royal Academy in 1856; I thought highly of it,
  and looked, but in vain, for a repetition of a success
  so complete as to cause the purchase of the picture
  by a well-known dealer, who had an engraving made
  from it, the print meeting with extensive popularity.
  Halliday's face was a very plain one, but totally
  unlike that of Tom Noddy: his hair was pale yellow,
  &quot;a vapoury moustache joining a soft beard, long
  but sparse whiskers;&quot; he was slightly lame, and altogether
  an elf-like quaintness in his appearance made
  him quite a remarkable little figure.</p>
<p>&quot;Leech,&quot; says Mr. Hunt, &quot;became intimate with
  him, and so under many names and ingenious disguises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> did Leech's public make his acquaintance&mdash;Tom
  Noddy, and a variety of names he figured
  under. Leech told of an expedition which formed
  a small party with Halliday one evening in the
  country, where there was to be a meet with the
  hounds next morning. As they dined and chatted,
  the attractions became greater every minute to the
  cavalier instincts of Halliday's youth. Leech and
  the others had horses coming, and on inquiry it was
  found that it would be possible for Mike to find a
  mount at hand, and so it was pointed out that he
  could sleep there and have a good day on the morrow.</p>
<p>&quot;'No,' said Halliday, 'I must find a train from
  town in time to be at the cover.'</p>
<p>&quot;'Why, in the name of mystery&mdash;why go to
  town?' said they all.</p>
<p>&quot;But all was useless&mdash;the little man would go,
  and would come back by a train starting very early
  from town; and so, to the bewilderment of all, he
  did. The next morning the friends went to see the
  train come in. As it stopped, down jumped the
  little Nimrod, decked out in carefully preserved
  pink, well-stained cords, with top-boots, and falling
  over the rim a tassel of ribbons in emulation of
  Sixteen-stringed Jack, as dandy hunting-men had
  dressed twenty years before.  He was capped with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> hunting-helmet, and he carried a magnificent riding-whip
  in hand. Seeing him thus walking and skipping
  with that outward turn of the feet, which is
  denominated in horsey parlance 'dishing,' Leech
  said that with all the desire in the world to treat
  the matter with supreme seriousness, as Halliday
  did, it was almost impossible for him to curb his
  provoked risibility.&quot;</p>
<p>Leech, in speaking of Halliday at a party, of
  which Holman Hunt made one, said:</p>
<p>&quot;Mike is a mine of resource to me. Whenever
  I am in difficulties I can remember something of
  him that it is possible to turn into a 'subject'; and,&quot;
  he added earnestly, &quot;I do hope he never recognises
  the resemblance, for I often put some point to prevent
  recognition.&quot;</p>
<p>The surprise at this innocence made the whole
  table burst into laughter, but in undeceiving Leech
  we were able to assure him that Halliday was by no
  means pained by the darts which had struck him;
  that he wore them proudly as decorations, and so
  disarmed the ill-nature that might be disposed to
  take advantage of the chance. He often achieved
  this by drawing the attention of his visitors to the
  last addition to his gallery of <i>Punch</i> portraits,
  exhibited on the walls of his studio.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>
<p>It must have been from some peculiarity of dress
  or manner, to which Halliday's attention was called
  by &quot;a candid friend,&quot; that he discovered that in
  drawing Tom Noddy Leech &quot;had him in his eye&quot;;
  for, as I said before, his face was as unlike that of
  Tom Noddy as Leech's own face was unlike the
  round, good-humoured physiognomy of Mr. Briggs,
  though some of the escapades of Briggs had their
  origin in Leech's personal experiences: a happy
  accident to the roof of Leech's house, and the noise
  and varied troubles caused in repairing it, was the
  suggestion of the famous scene of the Briggs
  disaster; and it was Leech himself who was caught
  by the leg by a policeman as&mdash;finding his front door
  blocked by scaffolding&mdash;he was attempting to enter
  in what that functionary considered a burglarious
  manner.</p>
<p>Leech was more fortunate than another artist
  of my acquaintance, for the officer listened to his
  explanation of the unusual way of entering his
  house, and, believing the statement, assisted him to
  &quot;make himself at home.&quot; But my other friend, who
  had been &quot;dining,&quot; finding something the matter
  with his latch-key&mdash;for do what he would he could
  not induce it to perform its usual office&mdash;mounted
  his area railings, and would very likely have fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> into the area if he had not been stopped by a policeman.
  The artist's attempts to explain his position
  were either incomprehensible by the officer, or they
  were not believed, for he was taken to the station
  and locked up for the night.</p>
<p>Leech gives us no hint by which we might guess
  in what condition of life the immortal Briggs made
  the fortune that enabled him to retire to his comfortable
  home in Bayswater; whatever his pursuit
  may have been, the taste for sport of every kind
  must have possessed the prosperous gentleman, to
  be indulged to the full&mdash;happily for us&mdash;when he
  had achieved independence.</p>
<p>Leech's powers are seen in their highest development
  in the Briggs drawings. Mr. Briggs
  is unfortunate in respect of horseflesh; the animals
  he selects are none of them free from vice, and in
  their various&mdash;and often successful&mdash;attempts to unseat
  their rider, they give the artist opportunities of
  showing his power of representing almost every
  action of which the horse is capable in the indulgence
  of that propensity. The enterprising sportsman
  chases the fox, coming in at the death, or soon
  after it&mdash;anyway, in time to give the huntsman half-a-sovereign
  for the brush, only he must &quot;say nothing
  about it.&quot; He rides steeplechases, and though he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> half drowned in a water-jump, and suffers other
  hindrances, he wins the race.</p>
<p>But it is in the shooting and fishing exploits that
  the sportsman and his illustrator shine most. Among
  so many triumphs of art and sportsmanship, it is difficult
  to say which of the many excellent examples is
  to be preferred; all are admirable, but I think the one
  I have chosen for illustration is my favourite. Mr.
  Briggs is deer-stalking, and though he occasionally
  suffers, even to prostration, from the heat of the
  weather, and the difficulties presented by hills, rocks,
  and heather, he really enjoys creeping and hiding
  with his gillies, until the royal hart, which the
  forester has seen through his glass, is well within
  rifle shot. He fires, misses; and behold the result!</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>
<img src="images/i_186.jpg" width="600" height="405" alt="" /> <span class="caption">&quot;<span class="smcap">After aiming for a Quarter of an Hour, Mr. B. fires both his Barrels and misses!! Tableau: the
  Forester&#39;s Anguish.</span>&quot;</span> </div>
<p>In expression, drawing, character, and action, the
  figure of the forester is perfect; there is a tragic
  grandeur in the pose that would be appropriate in
  the gravest scene of misfortune. Poor Mr. Briggs
  plainly shows us that he not only suffers from the
  mortification of having missed so splendid an opportunity
  of distinguishing himself, but also from the
  misery his mishap has inflicted upon the forester.
  The skilful way in which this drawing is composed&mdash;the
  three figures separated from each other presenting
  a difficult problem to the artist&mdash;excites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> one's admiration. Without the connecting links
  afforded by the forms in the landscape, and the lines
  made by the dogs in the leash, held by the young
  gilly, the figures would be unpleasantly separated.
  As it is, with the masterly effect of light and
  shadow, this drawing is above all criticism.</p>
<p>My elderly readers may remember a certain Mr.
  Rarey, an American, I think, who &quot;took the town&quot;
  by his horse-taming feats. A horse named Cruiser,
  which was in the habit of indulging in every wickedness
  that could disgrace a horse, became docile
  under the Rarey treatment. The tamer's method
  was a profound secret; he allowed no one to witness
  the working of the charm by which a furious animal
  was changed into lamb-like meekness. In Cruiser's
  case, what was certain was, that a creature unapproachable
  without risk to limb and life, was transformed
  to such an extent that a child might&mdash;and
  did&mdash;ride him.</p>
<p>In a number of admirably humorous drawings,
  Leech pictures Mr. Briggs, who comes to grief
  in all his attempts to emulate Mr. Rarey. He
  evidently does not possess the secret, and though
  we laugh over his failures, we respect the courage
  which led to them. &quot;Mr. Briggs tries his shooting
  pony&quot; is an inimitable drawing.  Mr. B. has no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> doubt been assured that the pony will take no more
  notice of a gun when fired from his back than &quot;if
  you was to whistle a tune as you was riding of him.&quot;
  In perfect confidence in the truthfulness of the
  dealer's assurance, Mr. Briggs fires. The pony
  instantly flies, rather than gallops, away&mdash;without,
  however, unseating Mr. Briggs, who clings to the
  saddle, clutching his gun still smoking from the
  recent discharge.</p>
<p>Mr. Briggs goes to Scotland after salmon, as well
  as deer and grouse. As a fisherman he is more successful
  with the rod than he was as a deer-stalker with
  the gun. A huge salmon, for which &quot;he would not
  take a guinea a pound,&quot; rewards him for a long and
  desperate struggle, in which he encounters obstacles
  in the shape of the slippery rocks and deep-water
  holes that distinguish a Highland river.</p>
<p>In Scottish scenery Leech is as much at home as
  he is in the turnip-field or the covert. No praise
  can be too extravagant for all the backgrounds
  that form so perfect a setting for the gem-like figures
  of Mr. Briggs. Nor must his attendants be forgotten.
  Witness the difference of character, so
  completely marked, between the snuff-taking bearer
  of the &quot;gaff,&quot; with his Scotch bonnet, and the
  forester in his kilt, who so pathetically mourns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> Mr. Briggs' failure, and who afterwards makes him
  &quot;free of the forest&quot; by smearing his face with the
  blood of a stag which has died by the accidental discharge
  of his gun.</p>
<p>During the quarter of a century of Leech's work,
  the British public had its crazes&mdash;Bloomerism, crinoline,
  spirit-rapping, and other less dangerous absurdities
  than the last, seized upon the minds of large
  portions of the people, to be thrown aside and replaced
  by other ridiculous fancies. Even games,
  after a time, seem to pall upon the players: cricket,
  happily, bids fair to be perennial; but croquet, once
  so fashionable, is no more. When one looks at
  Leech's drawings, in which crinolines figure so prominently,
  it is really difficult to believe that the
  artist has not exaggerated a frightful fashion; from
  observation I can assure a doubter that Leech has
  frequently under, rather than over, done the swell
  of those voluminous skirts. Of course, whenever
  they are permitted to do so, servants will imitate
  their masters and mistresses, and it was by no
  means uncommon for the ribs of a housemaid's
  crinoline to assert themselves through the outer
  skirt, as we see in some of Leech's drawings.</p>
<p>I would draw attention to the opposite, or antithesis,
  of this. In some of the cuts, prior, I think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> to the &quot;crinoline mania,&quot; Leech's delightful girls
  wear jackets of a form that follows the lines of
  nature, and of a very picturesque shape. These
  have a very short reign, being discarded in their
  turn by that Goddess of Fashion, the dressmaker, for
  &quot;something new&quot; and outrageous. There is amongst
  the &quot;Pictures of Life and Character&quot; a drawing
  of a dinner-party in which the male guests are so
  hidden and covered by ladies' crinolines that their
  heads and a small portion of their shoulders only are
  visible. How the gentlemen's hands are to be used
  in the consumption of their dinners is left to the
  imagination of the beholder, and of the sufferers.</p>
<p>For the unexaggerated truth of this print I, who
  write, can vouch; for have I not again and again
  been obliged to solve the difficulty of using my knife
  and fork? In spite of the attacks upon it, crinoline
  had its day&mdash;and far too long a day it was.</p>
<p>The Bloomer costume&mdash;a Yankee invention&mdash;made
  but a feeble struggle for existence, though it
  had many advocates, notably a <i>belle Americaine</i>,
  one of whose lectures at the Hanover Square rooms
  I had the curiosity to attend. The lady wore a red
  velvet overcoat and loose trousers, a broad-brimmed
  black hat and feather, and looked and talked like a
  pretty boy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>
<p>Bloomerism afforded Leech many opportunities
  of showing that his pencil could invest eccentricity
  with beauty. A study of the Bloomer sketches will
  also show that the attempt to adopt the manly dress
  was, in his estimation, an insidious attempt to usurp
  manly work and offices. In proof of this see the
  charming Bloomer omnibus-conductor, who is
  threatened by an elderly male passenger with a
  summons for abusive language; or the group of
  Bloomer police, who fly from a riotous mob instead
  of arresting the ringleaders. Look at her again
  as &quot;the man at the wheel&quot; who must not be
  &quot;spoken to.&quot; Those who have suffered from
  sea-sickness will see by the expression of the
  Bloomer's countenance why she should not be
  spoken to, and what the effect of conversation under
  the circumstances would most probably be. Leech
  gave his imagination full play in this fruitful theme.
  Granting the assumption of the masculine dress, he
  sees no reason why a proposal should not be made
  by the female lover instead of the male. Why, he
  seems to ask, should the gentleman have to undergo
  that terrible ordeal?</p>
<p>I advise my reader to seek in &quot;Pictures of Life and
  Character&quot; for a drawing of an elopement in which
  the positions of the principals are reversed. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> the lady who is pouring words of passionate persuasion
  into the ears of her frightened and half-reluctant
  lover, as he looks back at the home he is leaving for
  ever; she almost drags him to the carriage which is
  to bear the happy pair away to Gretna Green.</p>
<p>Spirit-rapping, table-turning, and the rest of it,
  fare badly at the hands of Leech. Happy was the
  thought that possessed him when, by a touch of his
  magic pencil, he changed the heads of a seance-party
  into those of geese. And how admirably
  humorous is the drawing in which furniture starts
  into life at the bidding of a medium, to the astonishment
  and dismay of the housemaid! Hats were supposed
  to &quot;turn about and wheel about&quot; under the
  influence of encircled hands round the brims. It
  would be a mistake to suppose that the handsome
  Guardsman who, with the assistance of the fingers of
  those pretty creatures, so patiently waits for the hat
  to move, has either the expectation or the desire
  that the experiment will be successful. No, he
  greatly enjoys the situation, and is eager to prolong
  it for any unreasonable time.</p>
<p>Here I cannot resist interposing a little anecdote
  of an experience of which I should like to have an
  explanation by the spiritualists. The incident took
  place on one of the many occasions when I served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> as a member of the dreaded Hanging Committee of
  the Royal Academy. As is well known, the Academicians
  have a vast variety of works of art offered
  for exhibition, perpetrated, as a rule, by human
  hands. But there is no rule without an exception,
  and it was my fate to witness the exception in the
  form of pictures painted by spirits, and sent for
  exhibition by their thrice-blessed proprietor. These
  were very striking works indeed. At first sight
  they looked like masses of many-coloured weeds,
  very weird vegetation, unlike anything &quot;in heaven
  above or on the earth beneath.&quot; On nearer inspection,
  some childishly-drawn, half-naked figures were
  discernible amongst the weeds, intended to represent
  spiritual forms of departed friends, probably,
  who had been changed into these unfortunate
  figures. These works received our most careful
  examination, created laughter, and were rejected.
  Now, I respectfully ask what the spirits were about
  thus to subject themselves and their doings to the
  ignorant ribaldry of the Academicians? They must
  have known that we were in a state of darkest
  unbelief, and the least they could have done was to
  warn the owner of these works of their certain fate
  at our hands, and thus have saved him the trouble
  of sending them to Burlington House, to say nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> of the expense of the handsome frames in which
  they were enshrined. &quot;I pause for a reply.&quot;</p>
<p>Archery and croquet afforded Leech opportunities
  for the display of beauty in many forms. His lady-archers
  are bewitching creatures, their male competitors
  always manly, graceful gentlemen. The
  pursuit of both amusements offered chances of love-making
  and flirtation, of which full advantage is
  sometimes taken; indeed, in one instance we see a
  game of croquet stopped altogether by a couple who
  find an interchange of&mdash;shall we say vows?&mdash;more
  interesting than the game; a feeling which, judging
  from the other players, is by no means shared.</p>
<p>Leech seems to have left no phase of human life
  and character untouched: whether he deals with the
  aristocrat or the plebeian, the Duchess or the beggar,
  the very poor or the very rich, the beautiful or the
  ugly, he is ever true to Nature; turning away from
  our vices, dealing lovingly with us in all ways,
  touching our follies lightly, humorously, and always
  good-naturedly&mdash;in short, invariably reflecting in his
  work his own disposition to what is pure, manly, and
  true.</p>

<h3>THOMAS HOOD AND LEECH.</h3>
<p>The difficulty of gauging public taste in matters
  literary and artistic can be proved by numberless
  examples. How often does the manager of a
  theatre place in trembling anxiety a piece before
  his audience which afterwards runs for hundreds of
  nights! &quot;Our Boys&quot; has had a long life upon the
  stage; but so doubtful was everyone connected with
  its production of its living for one night even, that
  another play was held in readiness to take the place
  of the damned one. Books that have made reputations
  for their authors have been refused by publisher
  after publisher. Engravings run the same perilous
  course. Print-sellers, from long experience of public
  wants, should know what will satisfy them; but they
  seem to find the difficulty that befalls publishers and
  the managers of theatres.</p>
<p>Many years ago a very pretty servant-maid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> became a part of my household. I induced her to
  sit for me, having noticed the graceful way in which
  her various duties were performed; and I made a
  half-length figure of her carrying a silver salver, on
  which was a decanter, thinking that the contrast
  between the silver, glass, and a pretty gray dress
  would make an effective scheme of colour. The
  picture was beautifully engraved by Holl, and
  offered for publication by a friend, who bought it,
  to one of the most experienced print-sellers in
  London. To please my friend, to whom the print-seller
  was under great obligation, he bought the
  right of publication; but having no faith in its
  success, my pretty servant was passed on&mdash;at a
  sacrifice&mdash;to another print-seller, and she afterwards
  found great favour with the public, and was highly
  remunerative to her proprietor, under the name and
  title of &quot;Sherry, sir?&quot; This title was the &quot;happy
  thought&quot; of the print-seller, who, on my remonstrating
  with him for vulgarizing my picture, informed
  me that the title had been the sole cause of
  the success of the engraving.</p>
<p>A print was published many years ago of three
  chorister boys in surplice and cassock, who, with
  open mouths and upturned eyes, are supposed to be
  singing.  In a moment of inspiration the artist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> who, I believe, was also the engraver, christened
  his subject, &quot;We praise Thee, O Lord!&quot; and then
  offered it at most of the principal print-shops in
  London, where it was invariably refused. The
  artist published &quot;We praise Thee,&quot; etc., himself,
  and, I was told, made more than two thousand
  pounds by it.</p>
<p>All this is introductory to the most astonishing
  example that could be conceived of the fallacy of
  what I may call expert opinion, on literary merit and
  public taste.</p>
<p>I am not sure of the precise date, but I think it
  was about 1848 or 1849 that Hood's &quot;Song of the
  Shirt&quot; appeared in <i>Punch</i>. There is, or was, a
  letter in existence from Hood to Mark Lemon,
  then editor of <i>Punch</i>, in which the writer tells his
  friend he has enclosed a poem that he may publish
  in <i>Punch</i> if he likes; but he &quot;most likely won't
  like,&quot; and refuse it, as the publishers, one and all,
  to whom it has been offered, had done without
  hesitation. &quot;In that case,&quot; said Hood, &quot;tear it up,
  and put it in the waste-paper-basket; for I am sick
  of the sight of it.&quot; This was the &quot;Song of the
  Shirt,&quot; one of the most powerful, touching, and
  pathetic poems in the English language.</p>
<p>My old friend, Willert Beale, whose recently-published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> &quot;Light of Other Days&quot; has charmed so
  many readers, sends me the following account of the
  introduction of the &quot;Song of the Shirt&quot; into <i>Punch</i>:</p>
<p>&quot;Mark Lemon&quot; (then editor of <i>Punch</i>) &quot;was
  looking over the immense heap of <i>Punch</i> letters
  on his desk, when he opened one enclosing a
  poem, which the writer said had been rejected
  by three contemporaries, and if unavailable for <i>Punch</i>, he begged the editor, whom he knew but
  slightly, to consign the paper to his waste-basket, as
  he was sick of the sight of it. The poem was
  signed 'Tom Hood,' and entitled 'The Song of
  the Shirt,' now so famous among us all. Of a
  totally different character to anything that had previously
  appeared in the pages of <i>Punch</i>, most of the
  staff were dead set against the insertion of it; but
  Mark Lemon, whose quick appreciation of its merits
  made him unwilling to let so valuable a prize slip
  from his grasp, over-ruled all objections with quiet
  though firm determination, and brought it before
  the public through the medium of <i>Punch</i>. The
  insertion <i>trebled</i> the sale of the number. Mark
  Lemon was always very proud of this success,
  which was certainly attributable to his efforts.</p>
<p>&quot;'Hood wants but one thing to make him
  famous,' he used to say, 'and that is death.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>
<p>&quot;His words were verified, for in poverty and
  comparative obscurity died one of England's cleverest
  men.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1849 some very painful disclosures were made
  in the Metropolitan police-courts, when it appeared
  &quot;that numbers of poor sempstresses were paid by
  the slop-sellers only three-halfpence for making
  a shirt, and in proportion for other articles of
  ready-made clothing.&quot; In all probability these disclosures
  suggested the &quot;Song of the Shirt,&quot; as they
  assuredly did the charming designs by Leech, called
  &quot;Pin-Money&quot; and &quot;Needle-Money.&quot; It seems
  to me almost an impertinence for a commentator
  on such admirable designs as these to point out
  the beauties so palpable to all who look at them.
  We sympathize with each of these classes of beings,
  for they are both the results of conditions that they
  have done nothing to create. It is certain that one
  of them is miserable, and it is by no means sure
  that the lovely girl's pin-money brings happiness
  with it.</p>
<p>There was everything in the shape of similarity
  of thought and feeling to have brought Leech and
  Hood into intimacy, but I doubt if they ever saw
  much of each other. Hood's comparatively premature
  death, preceded by much sickness and seclusion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> took place while Leech was far from the position in
  public estimation that he afterwards reached. In
  proof of similarity of humour I give the following
  note from Hood to Dickens:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="tdr"> &quot;17, Elm Tree Road, 1841,<br />
    <i>Saturday</i>.</p>
  <p> &quot;<span class="smcap">Dear Dickens</span>,<br />
  </p>
  <p>&quot;As you are going to America, and have
    kindly offered to execute any little commission for
    me, pray, if it be not too much trouble, try to get
    me an autograph of Sandy Hook's. I have Theodore's.</p>
  <p class="tdc"> &quot;Yours very truly,</p>
  <p class="tdr"> &quot;<span class="smcap">Thos. Hood</span>.</p>
  <p>&quot;My boy does <i>not</i> wait for an answer.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Miss Kilmansegg and her Precious Leg: a
  Golden Legend,&quot; is perhaps one of the best, as it is
  certainly the longest, of Hood's poems, remarkable,
  indeed, for its puns and ingenious play upon words,
  its felicitous rhyming, and its underlying moral.
  Miss Kilmansegg was born with a golden spoon in
  her mouth, and her condition is shown in the charming
  drawing with which Leech illustrates the following
  lines:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

    </span> <span class="i1">To plait the straw, or bind the shoe,<br />

    </span> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></div>
</div>
<p>The christening of the golden child was an affair
  so splendid as to tax the poet's invention for tropes
  and figures worthy of the occasion:</p>
<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&quot;Gold! and gold! and nothing but gold!<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">The same auriferous shine behold<br />
    </span> <span class="i3">Wherever the eye could settle!<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">On the walls&mdash;the sideboard&mdash;the ceiling&mdash;sky&mdash;,<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">On the gorgeous footmen standing by,<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">In coats to delight a miner's eye<br />
    </span> <span class="i3">With seams of precious metal.<br />
    </span> </div>
  <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&quot;Gold! and gold! and besides the gold,<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">The very robe of the infant told<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">A tale of wealth in every fold&mdash;<br />
    </span> <span class="i3">It lapped her like a vapour!<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">So fine! so thin! the mind at a loss,<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">Could compare it to nothing except a cross<br />
    </span> <span class="i3">Of cobweb with banknote paper.&quot;<br />
    </span> </div>
</div>
<p>Powerful as the poet's imagination shows in these
  glittering rhymes, it fails him in his endeavour to
  find a prefix in the form of a name worthy of accompanying
  Kilmansegg. He says:</p>
<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&quot;Then the babe was crossed and blessed amain,<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">But instead of Kate, or Ann, or Jane,<br />
    </span> <span class="i3">Which the humbler female endorses&mdash;<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">Instead of one name, as some people prefix,<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">Kilmansegg went at the tails of six,<br />
    </span> <span class="i3">Like a carriage of state with its horses.&quot;<br />
    </span> </div>
</div>
<p>The names, therefore, are left to the imagination
  of the reader, who may learn, if he will, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> particulars of the nameless Kilmansegg's childhood:</p>

<p>The kind of education permitted to this unfortunate

<p>Leech's drawings which decorate &quot;Miss Kilmansegg&quot;
  display his appreciation of beauty and character,
  and are, in some examples, of great artistic excellence&mdash;notably
  in the portrait of the foreign gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> who became the husband of the heiress. Some
  of them are, of course, deficient in the artistic
  qualities with which his long practice enabled him to
  enrich his latest work.</p>
<p>My space will not permit of my making many
  extracts from Hood's admirable work&mdash;only, indeed,
  so far as to explain Leech's drawings; but to those
  of my readers who make Miss Kilmansegg's
  acquaintance for the first time in these pages, I
  heartily recommend a perusal of the poem, and
  envy them the pleasure they will find in reading
  it.</p>
<p>Of course Miss Kilmansegg</p>
<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza"> <span class="i8">&quot;... learnt to sing and to dance,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">To sit on a horse although he should prance,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">And to speak a French not spoken in France<br />
    </span> <span class="i2">Any more than at Babel's building.&quot;<br />
    </span> </div>
</div>
<p>The steed was a thoroughbred of great spirit&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&quot;A regular thoroughbred Irish horse,<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">And he ran away, as a matter of course,<br />
    </span> <span class="i3">With a girl worth her weight in guineas.&quot;<br />
    </span> </div>
</div>
<p>I think it would be very difficult to find a description
  of any event in any book to equal Hood's
  account of the mad career of the Irish horse and its
  unfortunate rider:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem">

  <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&quot;Away she flies, and the groom behind&quot;&mdash;<br />

<p>The heiress recovers; but, alas! in her fall she
  broke her leg, and as &quot;the limb was doomed it
  couldn't be saved.&quot; A substitute must be found.
  Of what, then, shall the &quot;proxy limb&quot; be made?</p>
<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&quot;She couldn't&mdash;she shouldn't&mdash;she wouldn't have wood!<br />

    </span> <span class="i3">The proxy limb should be golden!<br />

</div>
<div class="poem">

<p>The golden leg became the talk of the town,
  kicking away all other attractions. The new novel,
  the new murder, even &quot;wild Irish riots and rum-pusses,&quot;
  were neglected; in fact, &quot;the leg was in
  everybody's mouth,&quot; and a grand fancy ball was given
  at the Kilmansegg mansion to celebrate the heiress's
  recovery, as well as to exhibit the golden leg. All
  the world and his wife worship at the golden shrine:</p>
<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&quot;In they go&mdash;in jackets, and cloaks,<br />

<div class="poem">

    </span> </div>
</div>
<p>The fancy ball was a great success, and at supper&mdash;which
  the poet describes in glowing language&mdash;the
  heiress's health was proposed:</p>
<div class="poem">

    </span> </div>
</div>
<p>The party being over, and the last guest gone,
  Miss Kilmansegg went to bed and to dream:</p>
<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&quot;Miss Kilmansegg took off her leg<br />

    </span> <span class="i1">The square was hushed, not a sound was heard<br />

<div class="poem">

    </span> <span class="i1">The time for repose had come at last;<br />

    </span> <span class="i3">The handsome, the gay, and the witty&mdash;<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">The man of Science&mdash;of Arms&mdash;of Art,<br />

    </span> <span class="i3">And the man who deals in the City.&quot;<br />
    </span> </div>
</div>
<p>The poet now rhymes delightfully of the time&mdash;the
  perilous time&mdash;when a choice has to be made of
  a partner in life for the heiress. The dream was
  realized so far as regards the number of her suitors,
  for&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza"> <span class="i6">&quot;to tell the rigid truth,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Her favour was sought by Age and Youth,<br />
    </span> <span class="i2">For the prey will find a prowler!<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">She was followed, flattered, courted, address'd,<br />

    </span> <span class="i1">Such was the Count&mdash;to give him a niche&mdash;<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">Who came to court that heiress rich,<br />

<p>In the whole range of Leech's art, no more subtle
  realization of character can be found than this
  wonderful drawing presents; in every touch, in
  every line, can be read the savage brutality of the
  man to whom the happiness of Hood's poor rich
  heroine is confided. How evident is &quot;the trail of
  the serpent&quot; over features not unhandsome! The
  love that could fail to be warned by such a face
  must be blind indeed. The poet's comments, and
  the contrast he shows between the lots of those who
  &quot;marry for money&quot; and those in whom simple and
  true love have been the guiding stars, are delightful.
  I add an example:</p>
<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&quot;But, oh! the love that gold must crown!<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">Better, better, the love of the clown,<br />

    </span> <span class="i3">As if all the fairies had dressed her!<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">Whose brain to no crooked thought gives birth,<br />

    </span> <span class="i1">Who wipes her lips, though there's nothing amiss,<br />

    </span> <span class="i3">In which her heart is audible.&quot;<br />

  his betrothed</p>

<p>But a short time probably elapsed between the
  betrothal and the marriage, which was solemnized,

<p>I confess I am disappointed with Leech's rendering
  of Miss Kilmansegg. I cannot see why she
  should be deprived of a portion of the sympathy
  one always feels for &quot;beauty in distress.&quot; Why
  should she be represented as the commonplace, red-nosed
  creature who plays the part of the bride in
  Leech's drawing? To be sure, the contrast she
  affords to the sweet little bridesmaid behind her
  heightens that young lady's attractions; but I
  cannot help thinking the heiress is hardly treated.</p>
<p>I pass over the wedding-breakfast, which was
  composed of everything in season, and of much
  that was out of it&mdash;</p>

  amongst the pleasures we receive from this delightful

  man,&quot; sufficiently proclaim their habits. The figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> of the Count is tragic in its intensity of drunken
  self-abandonment.</p>
<p>A leg of solid gold would, no doubt, if turned into
  cash, represent a large sum of money. It seems to
  have been the determination of the Countess, while
  still Miss Kilmansegg, to have reserved to herself
  all rights over the golden leg, for that auriferous
  limb was settled, as well as fixed upon herself, to be
  disposed of by will or otherwise, as she pleased.
  Says the poet:</p>
<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&quot;So the Countess, then Miss Kilmansegg,<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">At her marriage refused to stir a peg<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">Till her lawyers had fastened on her leg,<br />
    </span> <span class="i3">As fast as the law could tie it.&quot;<br />
    </span> </div>
</div>
<p>Means which seem illimitable very speedily vanish
  when they fall into the hands of such people as the
  foreign Count. It was said of a famous <i>rou&eacute;</i> of the
  last century that he &quot;practised every vice except
  prodigality and hypocrisy&mdash;his insatiable avarice
  exempted him from the first, and his matchless impudence
  from the second.&quot; Our Count seems to
  have surpassed his prototype, whose &quot;impudence&quot;
  may not have been of the brutal character from
  which the poor Countess suffered; whilst a slight
  dash of avarice might have prevented the golden
  leg from being all that was left of her golden fortune.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>
<p>The following lines eloquently describe the Count's
  state of mind after his orgies:</p>
<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&quot;And then how wildly he used to stare,<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">And shake his fist at nothing, and swear,<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">And pluck by the handful his shaggy hair,<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">Till he looked like a study of Giant Despair<br />
    </span> <span class="i3">For a new edition of Bunyan!<br />
    </span> </div>
  <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&quot;For dice will run the contrary way,<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">As is well known to all who play,<br />
    </span> <span class="i3">And cards will conspire as in treason.&quot;<br />
    </span> </div>
</div>
<p>At all events, cards, dice, and other expensive
  amusements had so reduced the Count that he had
  not a leg to stand upon, except his wife's golden
  one, and as that limb was in her own control, it was
  but a doubtful security. The Countess had made a
  will in which the leg was left to the Count, but life
  is uncertain&mdash;the Countess might outlive her husband;
  moreover, he was so placed that delay was
  not only dangerous, but inconvenient. The chronicler
  thus continues:</p>
<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&quot;Now, the precious leg while cash was flush,<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">Or the Count's acceptance worth a rush,<br />

    </span> <span class="i1">But no sooner the stocks began to fall,<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">Than, without any ossification at all,<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">The limb became what people call<br />

    but also in evidence of the readiness of the artist's
    imagination to adopt an idea that has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> suggested by the poem, and of the skill with which
    that cunning hand has realized it. The little old

    the delight that &quot;time cannot wither, nor custom
    stale.&quot; His shrunken shanks, thin face and hands,
    betray his age. Death cannot be far off; but no
    thought apart from the treasure can be spared for
    the inevitable visitor who surprises the miser at last
    in the midst of his golden worship. He is far from
    being tired; but he must go to bed, and sleep the
    sleep that knows no waking. His skeleton nurse
    has come for him; her bony hands encircle him.
    His shroud is on her arm; she cannot wait&mdash;no,

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>
  <h3>DR. JOHN BROWN AND LEECH.</h3>
  <p>Whether that charming writer, Dr. John Brown,
    knew Leech in the flesh or not, I cannot say; but
    that he knew and fully appreciated him in spirit is
    evident enough in a paper published in a collection
    of essays entitled &quot;Hor&aelig; Subseciv&aelig;.&quot; I gather
    from the concluding passages of the Doctor's brilliant
    essay that it had been his intention to have
    written Leech's life, having collected much material
    for the purpose, but that &quot;ill-health put a stop to
    this congenial labour.&quot; How admirably the labour
    would have been executed may be shown by the
    following extracts:</p>
  <p>&quot;Leech,&quot; says Dr. Brown, &quot;was singularly modest,
    both as a man and an artist. This came by nature,
    and was indicative of the harmony and sweetness of
    his essence; but doubtless the perpetual going to
    Nature, and drawing out of her fulness, kept him
    humble, as well as made him rich&mdash;made him (what
    every man of sense and power must be) conscious of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> his own strength. But before 'the great mother'
    he was simple and loving, attentive to her lessons
    as a child, for ever learning and doing.&quot;</p>
  <p>Again: &quot;Of all our satirists, none have such a
    pervading sense and power of girlish, ripe, and
    womanly beauty as Leech.... There is a genuine
    domesticity about his scenes that could come only
    from a man who was much at his own fireside, and
    in the nursery when baby was washed. You see,
    he is himself <i>pater familias</i>, with no Bohemian trait
    or raffish turn. What he draws, he has seen; what
    he asks you to live in, and laugh at and with, he has
    laughed at and lived in. It is this wholesomeness
    and (to use the right word) this goodness that makes
    Leech more than a drawer of funny pictures, more
    even than a great artist. It makes him a teacher and
    an example of virtue in its widest sense, from that of
    manliness to the sweet devotion of a woman, and the
    loving open mouth and eyes of <i>parvula</i> on your knee.&quot;</p>
  <p>I find it difficult to believe that these remarks
    were written by one who had no personal knowledge
    of Leech; indeed, I should have thought the writer
    must have enjoyed an amount of intimacy with him.
    If Dr. Brown and Leech were strangers to each other,
    the writer's accurate estimate of the artist shows how
    exactly the drawings reflect the delightful nature of
    their producer, so familiar to his nearest friends.</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>
  <p>&quot;What we owe to him,&quot; adds Dr. Brown, &quot;of
    wholesome, hearty mirth and pleasure, and of something
    better than either&mdash;good as they are&mdash;purity,
    affection, pluck, humour, kindliness, good-humour,
    good-feeling, good-breeding, the love of Nature, of
    one another, of truth, the joys of children, the loveliness
    of our homely English fields, with their sunsets
    and village spires, their glimpses into the pure infinite
    beyond, the sea and all its fulness, its waves
    'curling their monstrous heads and hanging them,'
    their crisping smiles on sunlit sands&mdash;all that variety
    of Nature and of man, which is only less infinite than
    its Maker! Something of this and of that mysterious
    quality called humour, that fragrance and flavour of
    the soul, which God has given us to cheer our lot,
    to help us to 'take heart and hope and steer right
    onward,' to have our joke, that lets us laugh and
    make game of ourselves when we have little else to
    laugh at or play with, of that which gives us when
    we will the silver lining of the cloud, and paints a
    rainbow on the darkened sky out of our own 'troublous
    tears'&mdash;something of all these has this great,
    simple-hearted, hard-working artist given to us and
    to our children as a joy and a possession for ever.
    Let us be grateful to him; let us give him our best
    honour, affection, and regard.&quot;</p>
  <p>Walking with Leech one day, we met an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> gentleman, to whom I introduced my friend: early
    in the fifties it was. The old man, though well
    stricken in years, sported a dark and heavy moustache.</p>
  <p>&quot;And so,&quot; said Leech, when, after a few commonplaces,
    we separated, &quot;that is old Mr. Blank the
    portrait-painter, is it? What on earth induces him
    to wear purple moustachios?&quot; Purple they were,
    certainly, and of rather a bright tinge.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,&quot; I replied, &quot;he has dyed them, for they
    were white the other day.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;In my opinion,&quot; said Leech, &quot;only soldiers
    should be allowed moustachios.&quot;</p>
  <p>In my early days, that &quot;hirsute appendage&quot;
    created such a prejudice against the wearers as
    would not be credited in these beard-bearing times.
    There were places of business the doors of which
    were closed against the moustache. At a well-known
    bank complete shaving of moustache and
    beard is insisted upon to this day. The sufferings
    of our troops in the Crimea were sufficiently
    agonizing without the torment or even the possibility
    of the morning's shave; and it is to the Russian
    campaign we owe the &quot;beard movement,&quot; which
    from that time to the present is so universal. Our
    officers returned from their battles covered with
    glory and hair, and so much improved by the latter&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> the opinion of those whose approval was most
    valued&mdash;as to make a sacrifice of it out of the question.
    Little did Leech imagine when he made his
    sweeping objection to the moustache, what a factor
    he would find it in his future work. How many
    delightful sketches turn upon it! Who can forget
    those two little rival snobs&mdash;rivals in the love of
    some fair approver of beards&mdash;who have withdrawn
    themselves from society during the incubation of
    their moustachios, and who, having accidentally
    sought the same suburban retirement, meet face to
    face, stubbly beard to stubbly beard, at a corner of
    a lane? And that precocious young gentleman
    who asks his sisters if they approve of the removal
    of a moustache, the presence of which they
    had never been able to discover!</p>
  <p>Under the heading of &quot;The Beard Movement,&quot;
    we have a British swell in a fainting state in the
    arms of a policeman; this serious condition having
    arisen from the sight of a postman with moustachios.
    In another drawing, policemen are marching to their
    posts of duty decorated by beards of such magnitude
    as to strike terror into the street boys, who
    scatter in all directions at the sight of them.</p>
  <p>In &quot;Pictures of Life and Character&quot; other examples
    of the alarm excited by the beard movement are
    given with the refined humour peculiar to Leech.</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>
  <p>I find I have to modify somewhat my conviction
    that Leech rarely adopted the subjects proposed to
    him for illustration; no doubt by far the largest
    number were the outcome of his own conception, or
    observation of incidents in his experience; but I have
    proof of several examples to the contrary. For
    instance, Mr. Holman Hunt says: &quot;One Friday
    night I had sat down to much correspondence, intending
    before concluding to write of two or three
    amusing facts picked up that might suit him (Leech)
    for illustration. It had become very late, and I was
    clearing away my paper, when, with vexation, I remembered
    his letter had not been written. I seized
    the pen, and on a page I drew two horizontal lines
    quite dividing the space. In the top I put: 'Scene&mdash;Kitchen
    garden, country cottage. <i>Dramatis Person&aelig;</i>:
    Factotum, master entering,' and then a line
    or two of dialogue.</p>
  <p>&quot;The second subject I treated similarly, and the
    third also, which was not so promising. I enclosed
    this without a word to Leech, and posted it with my
    other letters about two in the morning. The following
    Wednesday the two subjects, admirably treated,
    were in <i>Punch</i>. When next I saw him he was
    eager with excuses for not having written. He
    added: 'The letter when it was opened at breakfast
    was most opportune, for I had to leave town by five,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> and I was bound to furnish two designs before
    going, and I had come down without having the
    wildest notion what to do. The subjects in your
    note were ready-made, and I was able to sketch
    them without a moment's waste of time.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr. Hunt tells an anecdote of Kenny Meadows,
    the jovial Bohemian, whom, I hope, the reader of
    these pages may remember, that is so characteristic
    and amusing, and illustrative of his own nature and
    of that of Leech, that I insert it in this place.
    &quot;Meadows was quite at the head of the <i>Punch</i> artists
    when Leech joined them, and was naturally delighted
    by the praise bestowed upon his drawings by 'this
    ruler amongst the illustrators of <i>Punch</i>.' He&mdash;Meadows&mdash;declared
    that a sight of Leech's illustrations
    had so disgusted him with his own work that
    he felt inclined to give up art altogether. 'Why,'
    said he, 'should I go on giving proof after proof of
    my incapacity when you leave me so far behind?'
    This modest effusion was uttered early in the
    evening, and before the setting in of the gin-and-water
    period, which was destined to effect a striking
    change in Meadows' estimate of himself, and of the
    recent addition to the pictorial staff.</p>
  <p>&quot;Leech was a sincere admirer of Meadows' work,
    and of this he assured the self-condemning artist in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> no measured terms, instancing for special praise
    many of Kenny's designs brimming over with poetic
    conceits in the illustrations of Shakespeare.
    Meadows listened to Leech's compliments, and said
    it was 'deuced liberal' of him to say what he did.
    He then mixed himself a glass of gin and water,
    saying, 'Well, after all, it's wise to make the best
    of things, and be as jolly as one can under all circumstances.'</p>
  <p>&quot;The two artists then fell into general conversation,
    and into&mdash;on the part of one of them&mdash;the
    imbibing of much gin and water. Under the influence
    of the latter, Meadows returned to the
    subject of his own works, and proceeded to show in
    what respect they surpassed those of others&mdash;even
    Leech's, which were worthless from the absence of
    'poetry,' which ought to sanctify all art.</p>
  <p>&quot;'Give me imagination or nothing, my dear boy!'
    he exclaimed. 'I don't want your commonplace
    facts done with a little trick of caricature, as it is
    called. Why don't you aim at something better,
    something higher? I would rather do nothing than
    the things you do, which, not only in design, but in
    execution, are unworthy of a true artist.'&quot;</p>
  <p>All this was told to my friend by Leech himself,
    and, says Mr. Hunt, &quot;Leech's shrug of the shoulders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> expressive of bearing infinite disgrace, was the
    gesture of a comedian, but a hearty, good-natured
    laugh gave the real expression of the feeling left in
    his kind soul; there was not a jot of malice there
    against the severe judgment upon himself. The
    Scandinavian hero returning so sedate from victory
    that he might have been supposed to have suffered
    a defeat, or from disaster in the field, so composed
    that he might have been thought victorious, could
    not have surpassed Leech's manner in accepting
    both the praise and the censure of his elder
    rival.&quot;</p>
  <p>Another old friend of mine, Mr. Horsley, R.A.,
    offers further proof of Leech's occasional acceptance
    of suggestions for his designs. In the course of a
    walk Mr. Horsley was accosted by one of those
    itinerant traders to whom the street is the shop, and
    solicited to buy a rope of onions.</p>
  <p>&quot;Take the last rope, sir,&quot; says the man. My
    friend looks like a prosperous gentleman, to whom
    the offer might be made with a prospect of success,
    though the awkwardness of his appearance with the
    addition of a long rope of large onions in his hand
    would most likely prove a deterrent to the purchase.
    Mr. Horsley declined the offer, but it instantly
    occurred to him that such a proposal, if made to
    one of Leech's &quot;swells,&quot; would be intensely comic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> and he accordingly mentioned the incident to Leech,
    who smiled as usual and said nothing. A drawing,
    however, appeared immediately in <i>Punch</i>, but,
    strange to say, the incident is defrauded of much,
    if not all, its humour. The swell leaves nothing to
    be desired, except that he certainly should have been
    alone, and not, as according to Leech, accompanied
    by a lady, to whom the onions might have been
    useful. The absurdity surely consisted in the
    ludicrous position of a young gentleman who was
    subjected to an offer of which he would scarcely
    know the meaning, and much less likely to take
    advantage of it. My friend expressed his disappointment
    to Leech, who, with characteristic modesty,
    acknowledged his mistake.</p>
  <p>&quot;I may mention another curious failure,&quot; says
    Mr. Horsley. &quot;Leech came into my room one
    day roaring with laughter at a story he had just
    heard of two small boys who had been overheard
    discussing the age of a companion, and one said to
    the other, 'Well, I don't 'zactly know how old
    Charley is; but he must be very old, for he blows
    his own nose.' This is delightful as coming from
    the little chaps that Leech drew so perfectly; but,
    wonderful to relate, he represented the conversation
    as passing between a boy looking fourteen or fifteen
    and a girl in a riding-habit.&quot;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 458px;"> <img src="images/i_241.jpg"
 width="458" height="500" alt="" /> <span class="caption">&quot;<span class="smcap">He Blows His Nose.</span>&quot;</span> </div>
<p>I subjoin the first idea of that which seems to
  be the incident told to Mr. Horsley, though it fails
  to illustrate the scene as described by Mr. Horsley,
  or the rendering of it afterwards adopted by Leech.
  The sketch, however, will show the rough manner
  in which all the thoughts so perfectly expressed on
  the wood-block were first sketched by the artist.</p>

<h3>AUTOGRAPH-HUNTERS AND OTHERS.</h3>
<p>No doubt all painters, poets, literary men, Churchmen&mdash;in
  short, all men who have attained to more
  or less celebrity&mdash;become the prey of the autograph-hunter,
  either in the form of a boy at school, a
  young lady whose life is made continuous sunshine
  by the contemplation of your pictures or the study
  of your delightful poems, or an elderly gentleman
  who has watched your career with intense interest
  from its beginning. Each of these applicants, strange
  to say, avers that he or she will be made happier
  by the possession of your name on a card or a piece
  of paper which is enclosed for your signature, and
  in addition to your &quot;valued name,&quot; if you happen
  to be an artist, &quot;if you will add a slight sketch,&quot; the
  gratitude of the hunter will know no bounds. I
  have been guilty on one or two occasions of complying
  with a desire that seems to verge upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> unreasonable; but my folly is as nothing compared
  to that of Edwin Landseer, who was a frequent
  and willing victim to such imposition. On one of
  the many occasions when I had the happiness of
  receiving Landseer at my house, the conversation
  turned upon the autograph-hunter, whose habits
  were strongly anathematized by some of us; the
  great painter defended the craze as harmless,
  easily gratified, and complimentary to the objects
  of it.</p>
<p>&quot;Only this morning,&quot; said he, &quot;I had an application
  from someone at Birmingham for my name, and
  for a sketch of a dog's head added to it; well, I
  complied with both desires.&quot;</p>
<p>I confess to my surprise when I heard this, and
  I was amused on hearing artists who were present
  exclaim loudly against such a proceeding, as creating
  a precedent that they would be expected to follow.
  Harmless, however, is the autograph pest in comparison
  with the really terrible <i>album</i>, which bids
  unblushingly for work that may consume many
  hours of the time of the painter or the poet. Here,
  again, Landseer was a great sinner; many a splendidly
  bound album lies at this moment on gilded
  tables in stately English mansions, the homes of our
  &quot;old nobility,&quot; with delightful drawings of sporting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> scenes by that cunning hand; and there are instances,
  I am sorry to say, of the possessors being
  unable to resist the sums offered for the purchase of
  their treasures so cheaply acquired.</p>
<p>As I am speaking of Edwin Landseer, I seize the
  opportunity of expressing my great regret that my
  friend Mr. Sidney Cooper, R.A., in his recently
  published memoirs, should have created an impression
  in the public mind that Landseer was a
  drunkard. From my intimate knowledge of Landseer,
  I can aver that nothing could be further from
  the fact. I have dined in his company scores of
  times, and I have met him in all kinds of society, and
  under conditions which would have made the propensity,
  if it possessed him, irresistible; and never
  in a single instance did I, or anyone else, see
  Landseer even <i>excited</i> by drink. This was the
  habit of the man until about a year and a half
  before his death, when the brain disorder began
  which afterwards destroyed him. I cannot disguise
  from myself that if Mr. Cooper had questioned the
  physicians who attended Landseer in his last illness,
  he would have been told that a craving for drink of
  every kind is one of the peculiarities of the disease
  which every sufferer from it is quite unable to resist.
  I know that great care was taken to keep stimulants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> from the illustrious patient; but that he may have
  secretly possessed himself of wine or spirits on
  certain occasions, and in that way given a colour to
  the report of his drunken habits, is probable enough;
  but I venture to think a brother-artist&mdash;even if the
  charge of habitual intoxication could have been
  proved against this great painter&mdash;should have been
  mournfully silent; how much more careful, then,
  should he have been, if he desired&mdash;perhaps as a
  warning&mdash;to proclaim this terrible failing, to
  ascertain whether he had truthful ground to go
  upon.</p>
<p>I do not in the least apologize for the above,
  though it is &quot;far wide&quot; of the purpose of this
  chapter; but I feel that my complaint against
  albums is a little ungracious and ungrateful in the
  face of the admirable page of sketches with which
  my publisher has supplied me. (See note at the
  end of this chapter.)</p>
<p>Mr. Richard Bentley was the possessor of an autograph-book
  and album combined; but he did not solicit
  the aid of strangers to fill it, thereby creating a wide
  difference between himself and the ordinary album
  nuisance. &quot;My father,&quot; says Mr. George Bentley,
  &quot;started an autograph-book, and got Cruikshank,
  Leech, and some others to give a sketch, or, if not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> an artist, an autograph. Leech did one in colour.
  It was so superior to anything in the volume that I
  cut it out and framed it, and so see it every day in
  my life.&quot;</p>
<p>The idea is to reproduce some of the characters
  he was so fond of sketching, and some he had
  actually given; for instance, the girl in bed is, I
  think, from the scene where a man gets up at night
  to fire at some cats. The wife suddenly awakes, and
  finds him looking out of window, gun in hand, and
  imagines thieves. The <i>voyez vous</i><img src="images/i_246.jpg" alt="voyez vous"
width="45" height="52" class="mid" /> is delicious,
  and the old gentleman with &quot;Now, it's my opinion,&quot;
  etc., I am pretty sure is taken from a sketch in some
  work he had illustrated.</p>
<p>So far Mr. George Bentley, who shows that his
  father, who was the liberal employer of Leech,
  Dickens, Cruikshank, and so many others, had a <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> for his requests in favour of his album.</p>
<p>I supplement Mr. Bentley's remarks on this
  delightful page by calling my readers' special attention
  to that charming little boy and his dreadful old
  grandmother&mdash;&quot;Will Charley come and live with his
  gran-ma?&quot; Study well that little boy's face, beautiful
  as an angel's, as he looks wondering at the
  hideous old woman&mdash;will he live with her? not, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> think, if he can help it. See, also, the lovely little
  group of the ill-assorted couple&mdash;old husband and
  young wife. More terrible the lady's fate there than
  Charley's with his &quot;Gran-ma.&quot;</p>
<p>I have now to notice another album belonging to
  no less a person than the late Duke of Devonshire.
  Leech made the Duke's acquaintance while staying
  with Millais at the Peacock, Baslow, a place within
  easy distance of Chatsworth; where, by the way,
  Millais painted the perfect likeness of Leech which,
  by his kindness, is allowed to enrich this volume,
  and where, by Sir Joseph Paxton, I think, Leech
  was introduced to the Duke, and entertained with
  much kindness at Chatsworth. How the album was
  introduced to Leech, and whether the Duke asked
  for a sketch or the artist volunteered it, I have
  no evidence to offer; but that a design was made
  and repeated, the following letters from the Duke
  sufficiently prove:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="tdr"> &quot;August 6, 1851.</p>
  <p> &quot;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,<br />
  </p>
  <p>&quot;I am so much charmed with your device
    that I must have a seal engraved from it. Perhaps
    you would have the kindness to renew the sketch
    for me on a smaller scale, as I am unwilling to
    extract the leaf made valuable by you from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> book. The stone should not be larger than this,
    which, I fear, makes my request hardly possible.</p>
  <p class="tdr"> &quot;Most sincerely yours,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
    &quot;<span class="smcap">Devonshire</span>.&quot;<br />
  </p>
</blockquote>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"> <img src="images/i_248.jpg"
 width="300" height="169" alt="" /> <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Seal.</span></span></div>
<p>The reduced scale proved no obstacle, and the
  success was gracefully acknowledged as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="tdr"> &quot;London, April 14, 1852.</p>
  <p> &quot;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,<br />
  </p>
  <p>&quot;In these critical days of the Crystal Palace,
    let me request your acceptance of the seal for which
    you gave me the idea.</p>
  <p>&quot;And that you may not have any feeling as to
    depriving me of it, I must tell you that I have
    another.</p>
  <p class="tdr"> &quot;Believe me,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
    &quot;Most sincerely yours,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
    &quot;<span class="smcap">Devonshire</span>.&quot;<br />
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what was the subject of the drawing? In a
  courteous reply to my inquiry, I find from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> present Duke that he has no such drawing in any of
  his books, and he knows nothing of the seal. In a
  postscript to one of Leech's letters to his friend
  Adams, however, I find the following mention of it:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Look at the seal on this envelope. I told you, I
    think, some time ago about my making a little
    sketch for the Duke of Devonshire, and how kind
    he was about it, saying he must have a seal made of
    it. Well, he called here himself, and left me a most
    handsome and valuable seal the other day, of which,
    I confess, I am proud to send you an impression.
    As you say of some of your people, 'It's very nice
    to be treated so, isn't it?' The design of the seal is
    a spade turning up the Crystal Palace, in allusion to
    Paxton being a gardener.</p>
  <p class="tdc"> &quot;Ever yours, my dear Charley,</p>
  <p class="tdr"> &quot;<span class="smcap">John Leech</span>.</p>
  <p> &quot;31, Notting Hill Terrace,<br />
    &quot;April 20, 1852.&quot;<br />
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though the present Duke of Devonshire knows
  nothing of the seal, or the drawing from which it was
  made, I am happy to say that I am able to present
  to my readers an impression from it, through the
  kindness of Leech's son-in-law, Mr. Gillett, to whom
  I applied in my perplexity.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>
<p>Everybody may not know that Sir Joseph Paxton,
  the Duke of Devonshire's gardener, was the architect
  of the glass house of 1851, afterwards christened the
  Crystal Palace, which&mdash;greatly enlarged&mdash;now
  flourishes at Sydenham. I conclude this chapter
  with an extract from <i>Notes and Queries</i>, evidently
  written by a friend of Leech. The writer, under
  date November, 1864, says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Leech's success was owing to his almost daily
    practice of jotting in his note-book every remarkable
    physiognomy or incident that struck him in his
    rambles. Such, at any rate, was his practice at the
    commencement of his too brief career. On one
    occasion he and I were riding to town together in
    an omnibus, when an elderly gentleman in a very
    peculiar dress, and with very marked features,
    stepped into the vehicle, and sat down immediately
    in front of us. We were the only inside passengers.
    For whom or for what he took, or probably mistook,
    us, I know not; but he stared so hard, and made
    such wry faces at us, that I could hardly refrain
    from laughter. My discomfiture was almost completed
    when Leech suddenly exclaimed, 'By the
    way, did Prendergast ever show you that extraordinary
    account that has been recently forwarded
    to him?' and, showing me his note-book, added, 'Just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> run your eye up that column, and tell me what you
    can make of it.' Instead of a column, the features
    of the old gentleman were reflected upon the page
    with life-like fidelity. On another occasion I saw
    him strike off with promptitude and skill the scene
    of a quarrel between some dirty little urchins in a
    suburban village.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;To my great regret, I find that the
  material in which Mr. Bentley's drawing was
  executed made its reproduction impossible.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>
<h3>ARTISTS' LIVES.</h3>
<p>&quot;Silent, gentle, forbearing, his indignation flashed
  forth an eloquence when roused by anything mean
  or ungenerous. Manly in all his thoughts, tastes,
  and habits, there was about him an almost feminine
  tenderness. He would sit by the bedside, and
  smooth the pillow of a sick child with the gentleness
  of a woman. No wonder he was the idol of those
  around him, but it is the happiness of such a life
  that there is so little to be told of it.&quot;</p>
<p>I do not know to what friend of Leech's we are
  indebted for these few words; which are, however,
  sufficient to convey a perfect idea of the subject of
  them to those to whom he was only known by his
  works.</p>
<p>The lives of most artists are uneventful. Leech's
  short life was especially so. His incessant labour
  prevented his giving the time to what is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> society&mdash;that is so often devoted to it&mdash;to the loss
  of the happiness that home always afforded to him.
  He was a self-sacrificing and most dutiful son, a
  good and loving father and husband, and a true and
  faithful friend. In the quotation above we read that
  there is little to be told of Leech's life. I have
  talked with those who had the happiness of greater
  intimacy with him than I can boast of, without being
  able to learn anything beyond the ordinary events of
  an everyday life, void of dramatic incident, commonplace
  in fact, except for the constant triumph of an
  unapproachable genius.</p>
<p>Leech had a large circle of friends and acquaintances,
  with here and there an aristocrat amongst the
  latter; but his intimates were few: between them
  and him, however, there were unusually strong ties
  of affectionate regard; his nervous, modest, retiring
  nature often conveyed a false impression of him to
  casual acquaintances. I have heard him described
  as haughty, &quot;stand-offish,&quot; cold, and so on; and his
  manner to some of those who may have met him for
  the first time, occasionally admitted of that construction;
  but it arose from nervousness, or from an
  aversion to loud and ill-timed compliment, feeling, as
  he sincerely did, his &quot;little sketches&quot; deserved no
  such eulogium. Though Leech's life offers no field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> for the description of stirring events, the delightful
  nature of the man affords matchless opportunities for
  study, reflection, and emulation; and that study may
  be pursued in the examination of his works, in which,
  as in a looking-glass, the nature of their producer is
  reflected. There may be seen ever-recurring proofs
  of the artist's intense love of Nature in all her forms;
  whether he deals with woman, the most beautiful of
  all Nature's works, or with children in the endless
  variety of their attractiveness, absolute truth, tenderness
  and beauty are paramount; and not only are
  these creatures natural and beautiful, but the artist
  is at one with them in all their doings, from the
  sympathy peculiar to him with all that is simple,
  pure, and lovable. Side by side with this tenderness
  of heart, we have a robust manliness which shows
  itself constantly.</p>
<p>As a matter of course Leech's love of Nature was
  not confined to humanity, but was extended to the
  animal creation, to the trees and the fields, the sea-shore
  and the sea&mdash;in short, to every form of animate
  and inanimate nature. Think what a delight such a
  constituted heart and mind must be to the possessor
  of them! and not only to him, but to us to whom he
  so freely offers the results of his sympathies, making
  us certainly happier, and it is to be hoped better, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> the taking in of so much that is exhilarating, healthy,
  and true. Evidence is frequent of pity for the
  sufferings of the poor and the oppressed. In many a
  scene Leech becomes a warm sympathizer with unmerited
  distress; and constantly his honest heart is
  stirred into indignation at some instance of injustice;
  then we find that the pencil which can deal so gently
  with childhood and woman can also, in indelible
  lines, stigmatize the stony-hearted oppressor.</p>
<p>Underlying the refined and delicate humour that
  distinguishes the greater part of Leech's work we
  frequently find some more or less serious social
  grievance smartly satirized. In &quot;Servant-Gal-ism,&quot;
  for example, the airs and graces, the impudent
  assumption, and the dishonesty even, which sometimes
  disgrace those otherwise worthy people, are
  shown to us in drawings so humorous as to make
  us laugh heartily, but at the same time we feel the
  full force of the satire intended. In the encounters
  between servant-girls and their mistresses the ladies
  sometimes get the worst of it; notably in a drawing
  that represents a mistress and her maid in conflict
  respecting the dressing of their hair. The old lady
  has tortured her few remaining locks into miserable
  little ringlets, that make a shocking contrast to the
  long curls of her young and pretty servant; and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> sooner does she catch sight of the girl's ringlets, than
  she angrily tells her she will not permit such bare-faced
  imitation of the way she chooses to wear her
  hair. Here I am afraid we cannot help feeling a
  certain amount of contempt for the blind vanity and
  tyranny of the mistress, while we sympathize with
  the maid.</p>
<p>Footmen afford a wide field for the good-humoured
  banter of Leech.</p>
<p>Amongst the many striking proofs of the genius
  that distinguished him, is one that to me, as an
  artist, is astonishing. I allude to the individual
  character with which Leech invests each of his
  servant-girls and footmen, as well as every type that
  comes under his hand. I have not counted the
  number of servants of &quot;all sorts and sizes&quot; that
  appear in &quot;Pictures of Life and Character,&quot; but I
  am quite sure that a comparison of one with another
  will prove that not one can be found in the slightest
  degree to resemble another; each is an individual by
  himself or herself, separate and distinct&mdash;a footman
  from top to toe; take away his uniform, and, from
  some peculiarity of manner or action, he is unmistakably
  a footman still. The same may be said
  of the maid-servants, in whom Leech's wonderful
  power of individualizing is shown even more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> palpably; for the cook is a cook, and perfectly distinct
  from the scullery-maid and the charwoman;
  and no two cooks or kitchen-maids resemble each
  other personally, but only in their offices.</p>
<p>The same may be truly said of numberless types
  immortalized by Leech; but, strange to say, it cannot
  be said of the <i>young</i> ladies: they almost all have a
  family likeness to one another&mdash;a resemblance that
  can be traced to Mrs. Leech. This fault, for it is a
  fault, and a grave one, is as strange to me as the
  infinite variety shown in his representation of all
  sorts and conditions of men and women is astounding.
  In marking this I point to the only shortcoming
  in all Leech's work, and though, as I think (I
  may be wrong), he has this fault in his treatment
  of young ladies, it is absent in his drawings of
  elderly or old ones; the aristocratic or plebeian old
  women are as well marked in personal contrast
  with each other as the rest of his delightful creations.</p>
<p>The rest of his creations! What a dazzling, bewildering
  mass of humanity crowds upon the mind
  when one attempts to point out special scenes for
  examination and criticism! If I were to say a
  tithe of what I feel about hundreds of Leech's drawings,
  I should greatly exceed the space permitted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> me in this book, and I should also show how inferior
  my powers of analysis are to those of Dickens and
  Thackeray, and others whose delightful appreciation
  of beauty, humour and character are so eloquently
  set forth elsewhere in this memoir; and perhaps I
  may add that I have sufficient respect for the
  intelligence of my readers to convince me that they
  require no directions from me as to when they should
  laugh and when look grave, or where to discover the
  point of a joke that is palpable to the &quot;meanest
  capacity.&quot;</p>
<p>With Leech's work in an artistic sense I have more
  to do. Considering the limited means employed,
  the results produced are very wonderful. Nothing is
  left to desire in character or expression; the story is
  perfectly told in every drawing; and it can be read
  without reference to the few lines beneath, which in
  the wording of them appear to me as perfect as the
  cuts themselves. The composition of groups and
  figures, which looks so simple and natural, is the
  result of consummate art. The drawing, notably of
  figures and animals in action, is always correct.
  Chiaroscuro is too comprehensive a word to apply
  to the light and shadow of Leech's drawings; but
  in what we call &quot;black and white,&quot; or, in other
  words, in the distribution of the masses of dark, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> what I may term semi-dark, and light, they are
  always skilfully effective.</p>
<p>I have been told that Leech's work, in the opinion
  of a high authority in matters of art, resembles, and
  successfully rivals, the silver-point drawings of the
  old masters. I have seen many examples of those
  beautiful drawings, but I have never seen one that
  bore the faintest resemblance to the way in which
  Leech &quot;lays his lines.&quot; The same judge tells us
  that Leech's work betrays an ignorance of the
  principles of effect&mdash;in other words, a neglect of the
  laws that should guide an artist in the selection of
  his scheme of light and shadow. An intelligent
  glance at any of Leech's drawings will show the
  fallibility of that judgment.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>
<h3>LEECH EXHIBITION.</h3>
<p>About the year 1860&mdash;or thereabouts&mdash;there was
  exhibited in London a huge picture of Nero contemplating
  the ruins of Rome, by a German artist named
  Piloti. On seeing the picture I was much struck by
  a certain somewhat coarse vigour in the work, which
  asserted itself in spite of crude and harsh colouring;
  the principal figure&mdash;as often happens&mdash;was disappointing
  and theatrical. Nero stood in a melodramatic
  posture, with his arms folded, enjoying the
  destruction of the city. Leech, accompanied by
  his friend, the late Sir Edgar Boehm, R.A. (the
  eminent sculptor who made an admirable statuette
  of Leech), saw the picture, and after a long study of
  it he turned to Boehm and said: &quot;I would rather
  have been the painter of that picture than the producer
  of all the things I have ever perpetrated!&quot;
  Leech's friend received this avowal with incredulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> laughter, and, pointing out some of the glaring faults
  of the Nero, endeavoured to convince his companion
  that one of his drawings was worth acres of such work
  as Piloti's; in which I, for one, entirely agree with him.</p>
<p>The hankering after oil-colours which always
  possessed Leech was destined to be gratified;
  for soon after this&mdash;in 1862&mdash;he came before the
  public as the painter of a series of &quot;sketches in oil,&quot;
  being reproductions of his own drawings in <i>Punch</i>.
  These&mdash;almost virgin&mdash;attempts were exhibited at
  the Egyptian Hall, where they were visited by
  thousands of admiring spectators, who left several
  thousand pounds behind them. Everyone knows
  what a few inches of space are taken up by one of
  Leech's drawings as it appears in &quot;Pictures of Life
  and Character.&quot; A sketch of such small dimensions
  would have been ineffective in colours, and it was
  owing to an invention by which the originals were
  enlarged, that the artist was enabled to offer to the
  public copies of drawings four or five inches square,
  increased in some instances to three feet by two.</p>
<p>&quot;'The idea originated,' says Dr. Brown, 'with
  Mr. Mark Lemon, Leech's friend and colleague,
  who saw that by a new invention&mdash;a beautiful piece
  of machinery&mdash;the impression of a block in <i>Punch</i> being first taken on a sheet of indiarubber, was enlarged;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> when by a lithographic process the copy
  thus got could be transferred to the stone and impressions
  printed upon a large sheet of canvas.
  Having thus obtained an outline groundwork, consisting
  of his own lines enlarged to some eight times
  the area of the original block, Leech proceeded to
  colour these. His knowledge of the manipulation
  of oil-colours was very slight, and it was under the
  guidance of his friend Millais that his first attempts
  were made, and crude enough they were. He used
  a kind of transparent colour, which allowed the
  coarse lines of the enlargement to show through, so
  that the production presented the appearance of
  indifferent lithographs slightly tinted. In a short
  time he obtained great mastery over oil-colour, and
  instead of allowing the thick, fatty lines of printer's
  ink to remain on the canvas, he, by the use of turpentine,
  removed the ink, particularly with regard to
  the lines of the faces and figures. These he redrew
  with his own hand in a fine and delicate manner.
  To this he added a delicacy of finish, particularly in
  flesh-colour, which greatly enhanced the value and
  beauty of his later works.&quot;</p>
<p>The catalogue to the sketches in oil is prefaced by
  a few modest words by the artist, who concludes some
  remarks upon their production thus:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>
<p>&quot;These sketches have no claim to be regarded, or
  tested, as finished pictures. It is impossible for anyone
  to know the fact better than I do. They have
  no pretensions to a higher name than the name I
  give them, 'Sketches in Oil.'&quot;</p>
<p>The exhibition consisted of sixty-seven works, and
  the room containing them was filled all day long by
  a laughing crowd. Leech shrank from crowds at all
  times, and an assembly drawn together by his own
  works would have special terrors for him. After the
  opening of the gallery he was never known to visit
  it, mainly from his innate modesty, but also from his
  dread of being &quot;caught and talked at by enthusiastic
  people.&quot;</p>
<p>A story is told of a visit of a sporting lord who
  took his huntsman&mdash;whose judgment of hounds and
  horses was celebrated for its acumen&mdash;to give his
  verdict on the Leech Exhibition in general, and on
  dogs and horses in particular.</p>
<p>&quot;'Ah, my lord, nothin' but a party as knows 'osses
  could have drawed them there 'unters.'&quot;</p>
<p>If the huntsman offered an opinion on other
  features of the exhibition, it is not recorded; he
  criticised only what he understood&mdash;therein giving
  a much-needed example to many critics.</p>
<p>In the few remarks in the way of criticism on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> Leech Exhibition which I allow myself to make, I
  claim to be in the position of the huntsman whose
  experience of the horse made his opinion of that
  animal valuable; my own experience of pictures, as
  it extends over fifty years, may fairly claim for me
  the right of judgment, and I acknowledge myself to
  be one of those who thought the exhibition of
  &quot;Sketches in Oil&quot; did not increase Leech's reputation;
  though it happily did increase his own fortune,
  or the fortune of somebody else.</p>
<p>Dr. Brown says that Leech &quot;obtained a great
  mastery over oil-colours.&quot; The huntsman may have
  thought as much; if he did, he was as much in error
  as Dr. Brown. The sketches lost much charm by
  their enlargement, and they were further greatly
  damaged by the crude and inharmonious way in
  which they were coloured. The girls' lovely faces,
  which delight us so thoroughly in their pencilled
  forms, became almost vulgar under the artist's attempts
  to paint flesh&mdash;the most difficult of all things
  to render truly. When he first gives them to us
  fresh from the wood block, conveying to us, as he
  does, the most ravishing beauty by a few pencil-marks,
  we paint the faces for ourselves with the
  colours and brushes of the mind, with a result unattainable
  by the colourman's tools unless they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> in the hands of a Reynolds or a Vandyke. Leech's
  delightful backgrounds, too, were terribly spoilt by
  his oil-paints: air and distance disappeared altogether
  in many of them. But it is time my grumbling gave
  place to what Mr. Thackeray had to say about the
  Leech Exhibition in the <i>Times</i> of June 21, 1862:</p>
<p>&quot;Now, while Mr. Leech has been making his
  comments upon our society and manners, one of the
  wittiest and keenest observers has been giving a
  description of his own country of France in a
  thousand brilliant pages; and it is a task not a little
  amusing and curious for a student of manners to
  note the difference between the two satirists&mdash;perhaps
  between the societies they describe. Leech's
  England is a country peopled by noble elderly
  squires, riding large-boned horses, followed across
  country by lovely beings of the most gorgeous
  proportions, by respectful retainers, by gallant little
  boys emulating the pluck and courage of the sire.
  The joke is the precocious courage of the child, his
  gallantry as he charges his fences, his coolness as he
  eyes the glass of port, or tells grandpapa he likes his
  champagne dry. How does Gavarni represent the
  family father, the sire, the old gentleman, in <i>his</i> country&mdash;the civilized country? Paterfamilias, in a
  dyed wig and whiskers, is leaning by the side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> Mademoiselle Coralie on her sofa in the Rue de
  Br&eacute;da. Paterfamilias, with a mask and a nose half
  a yard long, is hobbling after her at the ball. The <i>enfant terrible</i> is making papa and mamma alike
  ridiculous by showing us mamma's lover, who is
  lurking behind the screen. A thousand volumes
  are written protesting against the seventh commandment.
  The old man is for ever hunting after
  the young woman; the wife is for ever cheating the
  husband. The fun of the old comedy never seems
  to end in France, and we have the word of their
  own satirists, novelists, painters of society, that it is
  being played from day to day.</p>
<p>&quot;In the works of that barbarian artist, Hogarth,
  the subject which affords such playful sport to the
  civilized Frenchman is stigmatized as a fearful
  crime, and is visited by a ghastly retribution. The
  English savage never thinks of such a crime as
  funny, and, a hundred years after Hogarth, our
  modern 'painter of mankind' still retains his barbarous
  modesty, is tender with children, decorous
  before women, has never once thought he had the
  right or calling to wound the modesty of either.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Leech surveys society from the gentleman's
  point of view. In old days, when Mr. Jerrold lived
  and wrote for that famous periodical, he took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> other side; he looked up at the rich and great with
  a fierce, a sarcastic aspect, and a threatening
  posture, and his outcry or challenge was: 'Ye rich
  and great, look out! We, the people, are as good
  as you. Have a care, ye priests, wallowing on a
  tithe pig and rolling in carriages and four; ye
  landlords, grinding the poor; ye vulgar fine ladies,
  bullying innocent governesses, and what not&mdash;we
  will expose your vulgarity, we will put down your
  oppression, we will vindicate the nobility of our
  common nature,' and so forth. A great deal has to
  be said on the Jerrold side, a great deal was said,
  perhaps, even, a great deal too much. It is not a
  little curious to speculate upon the works of these
  two famous contributors to <i>Punch</i>, these two
  'preachers,' as the phrase is. 'Woe to you, you
  tyrant and heartless oppressor of the poor!' calls
  out Jerrold as Dives' carriage rolls by. 'Beware of
  the time when your bloated coachman shall be
  hurled from his box, when your gilded flunkey shall
  be cast to the earth from his perch, and your
  pampered horses shall run away with you and your
  vulgar wife and smash you into ruin.' The other
  philosopher looks at Dives and his cavalcade in his
  own peculiar manner. He admires the horses and
  copies, with the most curious felicity, their forms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> action. The footmen's calves and powder, the
  coachman's red face and flock wig, the over-dressed
  lady and plethoric gentleman in the carriage, he
  depicts with the happiest strokes; and if there is a
  pretty girl and a rosy child on the back seat, he
  'takes them up tenderly' and touches them with a
  hand that has a caress in it. The artist is very
  tender to all these little people. It is hard to say
  whether he loves girls or boys most&mdash;those delightful
  little men on their ponies in the hunting field, those
  charming little Lady Adas flirting at the juvenile
  ball, or Tom the butcher's boy on the slide, or
  ragged little Emily pulling the go-cart, freighted
  with Elizerann and her doll. Steele, Fielding,
  Goldsmith, Dickens, are similarly tender in their
  pictures of children. We may be barbarians,
  monsieur; but even savages are occasionally kind
  to their papooses. 'When are the holidays?'
  Mothers of families ought to come to this exhibition
  and bring the children. Then there are the full-grown
  young ladies&mdash;the very full-grown young
  ladies&mdash;dancing in the ball-room or reposing by the
  sea-shore: the men can peep at whole seraglios of
  these beauties for the moderate charge of one
  shilling, and bring away their charming likenesses
  in the illustrated catalogue (two-and-six).  In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> 'Mermaids' Haunt,' for instance, there is a siren
  combing her golden locks, and another dark-eyed
  witch actually sketching you as you look at her,
  whom Ulysses could not resist. To walk by the
  side of the much-sounding sea and come upon such
  a bevy of beauties as this, what bliss for a man or a
  painter! The mermaids in that haunt, haunt the
  beholder for hours after. Where is the shore on
  which those creatures were sketched? The sly
  catalogue does not tell us.</p>
<p>&quot;The outdoor sketcher will not fail to remark the
  excellent fidelity with which Mr. Leech draws the
  backgrounds of his little pictures. The homely
  landscape, the sea, the winter road by which the
  huntsmen ride, the light and clouds, the birds
  floating overhead, are indicated by a few strokes
  which show the artist's untiring watchfulness and
  love of Nature. He is a natural truth-teller, as
  Hogarth was before him, and indulges in no flights
  of fancy. He speaks his mind out quite honestly
  like a thorough Briton. He loves horses, dogs,
  river and field sports. He loves home and children&mdash;that
  you can see. He holds Frenchmen in light
  esteem. A bloated 'mosoo,' walking Leicester
  Square with a huge cigar and a little hat, with <i>billard</i> and <i>estaminet</i> written on his flaccid face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> is a favourite study with him; the unshaven jowl,
  the waist tied with a string, the boots which pad
  the quadrant pavement&mdash;this dingy and disreputable
  being exercises a fascination over Mr. Punch's
  favourite artist.</p>
<p>&quot;We trace, too, in his work a prejudice against
  the Hebrew nation, against the natives of an island
  much celebrated for its verdure and its wrongs.
  These are lamentable prejudices indeed, but what
  man is without his own? No man has ever
  depicted the little 'snob' with such a delightful
  touch. Leech fondles and dances this creature as
  he does the children. To remember one or two of
  these dear gents is to laugh. To watch them
  looking at their own portraits in this pleasant
  gallery will be no small part of the exhibition; and
  as we can all go and see our neighbours caricatured
  here, it is just possible that our neighbours may find
  some smart likenesses of <i>their</i> neighbours in these
  brilliant, life-like, good-natured <i>Sketches in Oil</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>The publication of this sympathetic article in such
  a paper as the <i>Times</i>, by such a writer as Thackeray,
  no doubt increased the popularity of &quot;Sketches in
  Oil.&quot; However that may have been, its appearance
  gave the keenest pleasure to Leech, who is said to
  have &quot;rejoiced like a child, exclaiming:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>
<p>&quot;'That's like putting a thousand pounds into my
  pocket!'&quot;</p>
<p>By far the best examples of Leech's oil paintings
  are in the collection of his old warmly attached
  friend, Mr. Charles Adams, of Barkway. Instead of
  a garish stain of washy colour merely passed over an
  engraving, these small sporting subjects are painted
  in a good solid style, well drawn and carefully
  finished; carrying with them the conviction, to my
  mind, that Leech might possibly have been as great
  with the brush as he was with the lead pencil.</p>
<p>Amongst the &quot;Pictures of Life and Character&quot;
  there is a drawing of two young ladies sitting <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> on a rustic seat; from the books held by
  both of them it might be supposed they were
  reading, as no doubt they were, till one of them
  caught sight of their partners at the ball the night
  before, who by a strange coincidence are advancing
  upon them through the wood. The drawing is
  entitled &quot;Remarkable Occurrence,&quot; with the following
  explanation: &quot;On the morning after the dispensary
  ball, as Emily Deuxtemps and Clara
  Polkington were sitting in the plantation, who
  should come to the very spot but Captain Fastman
  and young Reginald Phipps!&quot;</p>
<p>I forget the year in which this drawing appeared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> The scene is laid at Scarborough, where Leech
  was passing his summer holiday. I was so taken
  with the beauty of the girls, the composition of the
  drawing, and its general adaptability to the making
  of an oil picture, that I wrote to the artist; and,
  pointing out these characteristics, begged him to
  &quot;paint the subject.&quot; I received no reply to my
  entreaty, but on meeting him afterwards in London,
  he apologized, and declared he would take my
  advice.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't mind my not answering you, old
  fellow: I hate letter-writing. It was very kind of
  you to write&mdash;glad you like the girls on the garden-seat.
  Well, I will try my hand at it the moment <i>I
  have time to spare</i>.&quot; The time never came. A
  &quot;Remarkable Occurrence&quot; did not even appear
  amongst the &quot;Sketches in Oil.&quot;</p>
<p>It would have been a very onerous task for a
  man in perfect health, and accustomed to the use
  of the brush, to have prepared those sixty-seven
  sketches in oil for exhibition, even if his time could
  have been wholly devoted to it. To Leech, with
  the hand of Death nearly touching him, in almost
  entire ignorance of the method in which he was
  working&mdash;the ordeal was terrible. To the entreaties
  of his friends that he should stick less closely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> his easel at Lowestoft or Whitby, he would reply
  that the fine air of the former, and the picturesque
  scenery abounding at the latter, were intended for
  idle people, and not for him.</p>
<p>To the man with well-strung nerves Leech's
  sensibility to noises of all kinds seems incomprehensible;
  but for years before the oil sketches were
  undertaken I knew of his sufferings from himself;
  and the world must have guessed them from his
  attacks upon the organ-grinders, the bellowing
  street-hawkers, and the thousand and one noises
  that distress the London householder whose livelihood
  depends upon his brain. Of course most of
  the drawings in which the organ-grinder and the
  itinerant vendor of stale fish figure, are highly
  humorous; causing the unthinking to laugh, unconscious
  of the terrible seriousness under which they
  have been produced.</p>
<p>Humour was so much a part of Leech's nature
  that it sometimes asserted itself incongruously. For
  example: One evening a convivial party of the
  Ancient Order of Foresters returning from, perhaps,
  the Crystal Palace, where high festival had been
  held, roused poor Leech almost to madness by a
  yelling uproar opposite his door. He left his work,
  and rushed bare-headed amongst them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>
<p>&quot;What are you making this horrible row for?&quot;</p>
<p>Then seeing the extraordinary Robin Hood kind
  of costume affected by these people, he said:</p>
<p>&quot;What's it all about&mdash;who are you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are Foresters, that's what we are,&quot; was the
  reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Then, why on earth don't you go into a forest
  and make your infernal row there, instead of
  disturbing a whole street with your noise?&quot; said
  Leech.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that hyper-sensitiveness to
  noises troubled Leech &quot;from his youth up,&quot; for we
  find in comparatively early drawings in <i>Punch</i> examples of the nuisances created by the fish-hawkers,
  and the sellers of the great variety of
  things that nobody wants, at the different seaside
  places where he took his so-called holidays. He
  was naturally hard upon the encouragers of these
  pests. There is an inimitable sketch of an old lady
  who has called an organ-grinder into her parlour.
  The man, a perfect type of the Italian performer,
  grinds away at his instrument, the old woman snaps
  her fingers and kicks up her heels in mad delight;
  her parrot screams, and her dog howls an accompaniment.
  Cake and wine are on the table, and
  there is a stuffed cat in a glass case on the wall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> The drawing is called a &quot;Fancy Sketch of the Old
  Party who rather likes Organ-grinding.&quot;</p>
<p>In another sketch an elderly paterfamilias is seen
  sitting upon the beach attempting to read his newspaper
  under the difficulties caused by a boy with
  guinea-pigs, and others with something to sell; a
  sailor proposes a sail, an old woman has a box of
  baby linen, and the inevitable sweetstuff merchant
  looms in the near distance. The drawing is entitled
  &quot;The Bores of the Beach,&quot; with the following explanatory
  lines:</p>
<p>&quot;So, as it's a fine day, you'll sit on the beach and
  read the paper comfortably, will you? Very good!
  Then we recommend you to get what guinea-pigs,
  brandy-balls, boats, and children's socks, to say
  nothing of shell-work boxes, lace collars, and the
  like you may want, before you settle down.&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps the drawing that most happily illustrates
  the terrible suffering that is caused by those
  wandering minstrels, the Italian organ-grinders, is
  in double form&mdash;two <i>scenes</i>, so to speak. The first
  represents a dignified, middle-aged father of a family
  who stands at his door &quot;expostulating with an
  organ-grinder, who is defying him with extreme
  insolence, alternated with performances on the
  instrument of torture,&quot; says Leech. The Italian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> who is an embodiment of brutal impudence, says,
  &quot;Ha! ha! P'lice! Where you find p'lice?&quot;</p>
<p>In the second drawing we see why the noise is
  more than commonly distressing, for it represents
  a bedroom in the indignant father's house, where
  a &quot;sick boy, tended by his mother, is suffering from
  nervous fever.&quot;</p>
<p>I dwell at some length upon these drawings,
  because they greatly aided Mr. Bass in his efforts to
  put a stop to some extent&mdash;alas! only to some
  extent&mdash;to a serious public nuisance. The Bill
  which that gentleman carried through Parliament
  still requires amendment before the author, the
  musician, the artist, or the tradesman even, can
  pursue his calling in the peace so essential to
  success.</p>
<p>An eminent artist friend of mine lived in a part of
  the town where organ-grinders greatly congregate.
  The interruptions to his work were constant and
  terrible. After finding that remonstrance, threats of
  the police, and other inducements, failed to procure
  relief, he armed himself with a pea-shooter, with
  which he practised upon his lay figure until he acquired
  considerable skill in the use of it; and when he
  considered he was enough of a marksman, he stood
  by his shutter window and waited; not for long, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> the notes of &quot;Champagne Charley is my name&quot;&mdash;a
  favourite melody some years ago&mdash;pierced his ears
  from &quot;an instrument of torture&quot; opposite to his
  window. Through a narrow aperture made by the
  shutter the pea-shooter was projected, a smart blow
  on the cheek of the organ-grinder stopped &quot;Champagne
  Charley&quot; in the middle of one of his notes;
  the man rubbed his face and looked about him, up
  and down and round about, with an expression of
  pained surprise pleasant to behold. He then took
  up the tune where he had left it, and had produced
  a few more notes when a blow upon the grinding
  hand, and another almost instantly on his face, again
  stopped the performance. &quot;It was very gratifying,&quot;
  said my friend, &quot;to study the puzzled expression of
  the fellow as he looked about for the cause of his
  trouble.&quot; After another attempt to play out his
  tune, and another salute from the pea-shooter, he
  shouldered his organ and took himself off. &quot;Yes,&quot;
  said the sportsman, &quot;after a while they found me
  out, but they couldn't get at me, and now I am
  never troubled by any of them.&quot;</p>
<p>I am writing these pages at Lowestoft, where Leech
  passed several summer holidays. Under the name of
  &quot;Sandbath,&quot; this place had the honour of appearing
  in <i>Punch</i> as the scene of several humorous incidents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> notably of one in which the street-horrors are
  stigmatized under the heading of &quot;How to Make a
  Watering-place Pleasant, particularly to Invalids.&quot;
  Time 6.30 a.m. (a hint to the powers that be at
  Sandbath). The principal performer is an admirably
  drawn figure of a big burly ruffian&mdash;ugliness
  personified&mdash;from whose monstrous mouth one can
  almost hear &quot;Yah-ha-bloaters!&quot; Two little boys,
  carrying baskets of shrimps, are yelling &quot;Ser-imps,
  fine ser-imps!&quot; while two more youths add to the
  din by ringing bells by way of announcing other
  delicacies likely to be in request early in the
  morning. The date of this drawing can be fixed
  pretty accurately, for I hear from Mr. Adams that
  several of the sketches in oil exhibited in 1862 were
  finished at this place, Mr. Adams constantly watching
  his friend as he worked.</p>
<p>To the unexaggerated truth of the incident I can
  speak, for the cry of &quot;Bloaters!&quot; arouses me every
  morning, and precisely at the time indicated by
  Leech. Added to this, even as I write about the
  organ-grinder detested of Leech, comes one, as if
  in revenge, under my window; and in reply to
  my threat of police, I am told to &quot;go and <i>find</i> a
  policeman&quot;&mdash;an impossibility, as the wretch well
  knows, for there is but one in Sandbath&mdash;as far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> as my observation goes&mdash;and he never appears in
  this part of it.</p>
<p>A petition, very numerously signed by eminent
  members of all the professions, and by others, was
  a formidable weapon in Mr. Bass's hands in his
  crusade against street musicians and other peace-breakers.
  The Bill passed both Houses, and became
  law. Leech signalized the success by an admirable
  drawing called &quot;The Rival Barrels.&quot; </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Three cheers for Bass and his barrel of beer, and out with
    the foreign ruffian and his barrel-organ.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of Mr. Bass's draymen is using a cask of
  beer in the form of a weapon as he rolls it against
  a foreign organ-grinder, who finds himself perilously
  near the edge of a cliff at Dover or Folkestone, <i>en
  route</i> from the country he has tormented so long.
  The brutal Italian scowls and threatens as the barrel
  rolls upon him, but we feel he must go; the stalwart,
  good-humoured drayman is too much for him.</p>
<p>If&mdash;as I feel sure&mdash;the brilliant powers possessed
  by Leech were certain to be attended by a highly
  sensitive and nervous organization, absolute tranquillity
  and ease of mind were required for the
  exercise of them; but in this unhappy case what
  do we find? No repose&mdash;no cessation&mdash;no peace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> The conditions under which these wonderful drawings
  were produced were no doubt to some extent
  uncontrollable&mdash;the public appetite grew with what it
  fed on; it was not <i>Punch</i> only who insisted upon his
  weekly portion, but numberless publications, stories,
  biographies, poems, taxed the genius of the popular
  illustrator.</p>
<p>It was not till I undertook this task that I had any
  idea of the <i>quantity</i> of work done by Leech: to say
  nothing of the excellence of it, the quantity is astonishing.
  But surely, I hear my reader say, though <i>Punch</i> required ever-recurring contributions, other
  demands upon the artist were within his own control.
  There are men, and plenty of them, who would have
  turned deaf ears to appeals from relatives and friends;
  but John Leech was not one of those, and I fear it
  cannot be denied it was to meet pressing solicitation
  for money from various quarters that we must look
  to account for the worn brain and the shattered
  nerves that throbbed with agony at noises which
  would scarcely have disturbed a healthy man.</p>
<p>For some years before his death he suffered from
  sleeplessness, and at length he yielded to the suggestion
  of his friends and the order of his doctor&mdash;that
  change of air and scene should be tried as a remedy.
  Mark Lemon became his companion, and the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> went to Biarritz, staying a short time in Paris on
  their way.</p>
<p>&quot;That Leech's pencil was not idle on this holiday,&quot;
  says Shirley Brooks, &quot;two well-known pictures
  will testify. One of them is a general view of that
  now famous watering-place, with specimens of its
  curious frequenters. The other is a very remarkable
  drawing. It represents a bull-fight as seen by a
  decent Christian gentleman, and, for the first time
  since the brutal fray was invented, the cold-blooded
  barbarity and stupidity of the show is depicted without
  any of the flash and flattery with which it has
  pleased artists to treat the atrocious scene. That
  grim indictment of a nation professing to be civilized
  will be on record for many a day after the offence
  shall have ceased.</p>
<p>&quot;This brief visit,&quot; continues Mr. Brooks, &quot;to the
  Continent was his last but one. His strength did
  not increase, and he no longer found pleasure in
  hunting, of which he had been exceedingly fond,
  and later he discontinued riding on horseback. He
  was then not merely advised, but ordered to travel.
  About this time the great man who had been to him
  as a brother, the schoolmate of his boyhood, the
  chief friend of his manhood&mdash;Thackeray&mdash;died. He
  told Millais of his presentiment that he, too, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> die suddenly, and soon. In the summer of 1864 he
  went to Homburg, accompanied by his friend,
  Alfred Elmore, and afterwards he sojourned at
  Schwalbach. His mind was amused if his body was
  not strengthened by these visits to new scenery, and
  his sketch-book was soon filled with memorials, some
  of which he embodied in his last large <i>Punch</i> engraving&mdash;a
  view of the place where the residents of
  Schwalbach meet to drink the waters, and with figures
  of illustrious political people.</p>
<p>&quot;Soon after his return he resolved to try what pure
  fresh English air would do for him, and accompanied
  by his family he went to Whitby. Several friends
  were also staying there at the same time, and he
  wrote to London that he liked the place. In
  September, on his writing to me that he would
  prolong his stay if I and wife would come down, we
  went, and remained at Whitby till he left it, on the
  3rd of October.</p>
<p>&quot;The scenery round Whitby is varied, and some of
  it is exceedingly fine; and Leech, when we could
  induce him to leave the painting in oil&mdash;to which he
  devoted far too many hours&mdash;enjoyed the drives into
  the wild moors, and up and down the terrible but
  picturesque roads; and he was still more delighted
  with the rich woods, deep glades, and glorious views<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> around Mulgrave Castle. I hoped that good was
  being done; but it was very difficult to stir him
  from his pictures, of which he declared he must
  finish a great number before Christmas. It was not
  for want of earnest and affectionate remonstrance
  close by his side, nor for lack of such remonstrance
  being seconded by myself and others, that he persevered
  in over-labour at these paintings, which he
  had undertaken with his usual generosity, in order to
  provide a very large sum of money <i>for the benefit of
  his relatives, not of his own household</i>. It need
  hardly be said that he was never pressed for work
  by his old friend the editor of <i>Punch</i>. His contributions
  to that periodical had not exceeded one half-page
  engraving for some time, until he volunteered
  to compose the large Schwalbach picture. Let me
  note another instance of his kindness to utter
  strangers. A deputation from the Whitby Institute
  waited upon him to ask him to attend a meeting,
  and to speak in promotion of the interests of the
  association. He was on that day too ill to bear an
  interview with more than one of the gentlemen, and
  was, of course, compelled to refuse their request.
  But it occurred to him that they might think his
  refusal ungracious (as I am sure they could not), and
  he sent for all his 'Sketches of Life and Character'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span> from London, and presented them to the Institution.&quot;</p>
<p>Amongst the party at Whitby was Mr. George
  Du Maurier, whose charming drawings are familiar,
  not only to the readers of <i>Punch</i>, but also as excellent
  illustrations in other newspapers and periodicals;
  especially good are they in Thackeray's great novel
  of &quot;Esmond.&quot; Du Maurier only made Leech's
  acquaintance a few months before his death, but he
  tells me that in the Whitby walks and talks he
  found him to be the most delightful companion, and
  the most &quot;lovable&quot; of men. My friend also tells me
  that he was the last of the craft that shook the hand
  to which we all owe so much. Du Maurier called
  upon Leech the day before his death to present a
  little drawing to him; he seemed &quot;much as usual,&quot;
  and the artists parted, little dreaming that they had
  parted for ever.</p>
<p>On the day after Mr. Hill's party the weekly
  dinner of the <i>Punch</i> staff took place. Leech attended
  as usual, but the readiness with which he
  was wont to make suggestions, or to discuss those
  already made, seemed to have deserted him. He
  was dull, silent, and appeared, says Shirley Brooks,
  &quot;scarcely to understand what was going on&quot;&mdash;requiring
  a question to be repeated two or three times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> before he could frame a reply to it, and then
  his answer was often wide of the mark. This condition,
  I suppose, showed the alternations of the
  disease that was killing him, for he was perfectly
  free from such a distressing symptom only the night
  before the <i>Punch</i> dinner, and as free from it,
  according to Du Maurier, the day before his death.</p>
<p>The journeys abroad, and the Whitby sojourn,
  even if the sufferer could have been prevailed upon
  to cease work altogether, came too late. The sword
  had worn out the scabbard. Leech's conversation
  and letters after his return from Whitby expressed
  ardent hope, but feeble conviction, that he had
  materially benefited by the change of air and scene.
  I think he knew that his prophecy, so mournfully
  spoken to Millais by the death-bed of Thackeray,
  was near its fulfilment. In common with all Leech's
  friends, I knew that he had suffered from attacks of
  angina pectoris, or breast pang; but in our ignorance
  of the serious character of the disease, most of us
  thought lightly of its attacks. One idea amongst us
  was that he had strained, and perhaps injured, some
  muscle in one of his hunting tumbles. That the
  agony of the spasms was very dreadful we knew,
  because on one occasion, after a severe attack, he
  said, &quot;If it had lasted a little longer, I must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> died.&quot; But how often have sufferers used the same
  words when they were in no danger whatever!</p>
<p>I approach the end of my endeavour to show my
  illustrious friend in his true colours, with sad feelings,
  grievously increased by the conviction that
  under happier circumstances he might have been
  the delight of all who did&mdash;and did not&mdash;know him
  for many years beyond the time so cruelly shortened.
  The letter to a friend which follows&mdash;written at
  Kensington after his return from Whitby&mdash;gives us
  in his own melancholy words a sad account of his
  condition.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="tdr"> &quot;6, The Terrace, Kensington,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
    &quot;October 6, 1864.</p>
  <p> &quot;<span class="smcap">My dear</span> &mdash;&mdash;,<br />
  </p>
  <p>&quot;I received your most kind note last night
    on my return from Whitby in Yorkshire, where
    I have been with my family since I came from
    Germany; and I assure you I have so many things
    to put in order, that to go away from my work
    would be impossible just now. I was amused with
    Homburg, and to some extent I think the waters
    did me some good; but I am sorry to say I can
    give but a sorry account of my health. Nothing
    seems to quiet my nervous system, and I suffer still
    from sleeplessness dreadfully. Alas for Sheldrake!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> Why, I could not ride him if I had him; anything
    out of a walk would bring on a spasm that would
    occasion me to drop from his back. I trust I may
    be able to ride some time yet, but do not see my
    way. As for shooting, you would see me disappear
    amongst the turnips in about five minutes from
    exhaustion. But, however, I look forward with
    hope, and with a will, shall try and make myself a
    better man; and I am not yet incapable, thank
    God, to enjoy the society of a friend, and hope
    you will find me out&mdash;no, not out, but at home&mdash;should
    you come to London this autumn or winter.
    You must see a pantomime, you know. I have one
    great consolation&mdash;that the air of Yorkshire did my
    wife and children great good; and hoping that you
    and all your kind relations at ... are well,</p>
  <p class="tdr"> &quot;Believe me,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
    &quot;Yours faithfully,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

<h3>MILLAIS AND LEECH.</h3>
<p>The way to a certain place is said to be paved
  with good intentions. If that be so, a large space
  in the pavement must be filled by intentions to
  write the life of Leech. In the Dean of Rochester&mdash;the
  intimate friend of the artist when known as
  the Rev. Reynolds Hole&mdash;the intention still exists,
  as I gather from a letter received from him
  in reply to my appeal for assistance. The Dean
  tells me he possesses &quot;above a hundred letters&quot; by
  Leech&mdash;one and all denied to me&mdash;barred by the
  &quot;intention,&quot; which seems to have come to life
  again, after being resigned by him many years ago
  in favour of Dr. John Brown; who in his turn
  relegated his intention to its place in the pavement.</p>
<p>I think it was about the year 1882 that, when
  calling on my old friend Sir John Millais, I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span> introduced to a Mr. Evans, who was presented to
  me as a literary man engaged in writing the life of
  Leech&mdash;a stranger to Millais in quest of information.
  Though I felt that Millais, in the genial and
  hearty way peculiar to him, over-estimated the
  importance of my assistance in his advice to Mr.
  Evans to tax my memory, &quot;and he would find the
  tax paid in full,&quot; I promised to try to remember
  something of interest, and communicate with him
  further. The result of the &quot;taxation&quot; was a paper,
  which I sent to the address given to me at Manchester.</p>
<p>Years passed, and as I heard nothing I concluded
  that the Evans life was abandoned, and thought no
  more of the matter. Alas! events proved that the
  Evans intention was destined to take its place
  amongst the others, for the promoter died; but
  not till he had collected a quantity of material, to
  which I have been greatly indebted in writing this
  memoir. After my interview with Mr. Evans at
  Millais', I never saw or heard from him, except in
  acknowledgment of my contribution; and it is
  strange to me, that with every requisite for the
  carrying out of the intention, into which, judging
  from his manner, he entered enthusiastically and
  lovingly, he should have made such little way with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span> it&mdash;probably from ill-health&mdash;when the material
  fell into the hands of Messrs. Bentley, and from
  theirs into mine.</p>
<p>Amongst the papers I found the following from Sir
  John Millais, of all the friends of Leech one of the
  dearest, the most loving and steadfast, and the best
  able to appreciate his qualities as an artist and a
  man. In a letter to Mr. Evans&mdash;February, 1882&mdash;Millais
  says:</p>
<p>&quot;I knew John Leech intimately, and I think saw
  more of him than any other of his friends. He
  was one of the very best gentlemen I ever knew,
  with an astounding appreciation of everything sad
  or humorous. He was both manly and gentle,
  nervous and brave, and the most delightful companion
  that ever lived. I loved John Leech (and
  another who is also gone) better than any other
  friends I have known.&quot;</p>
<p>In a further communication, Sir John says:</p>
<p>&quot;I will endeavour to find some letters which
  may be of interest. Unfortunately, I have given
  most of them away at the time I received them,
  many containing sketches; I cannot remember now
  where they are. I am sure I had more than anyone,
  as I was for years his daily companion. There
  is another friend of his&mdash;Percival Leigh, attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span> to <i>Punch</i>&mdash;whom you do not mention. You should
  see him, as he could give you a great deal of information.
  Mr. Adams was a hunting friend, and
  many times Leech and myself stayed with him.
  Mr. Parry was the master of the Puckeridge hounds,
  and most of the hunting sketches were the upshot
  of scenes in Hertfordshire.</p>
<p>&quot;Leech stayed with me twice in Scotland, and
  out of those visits came Mr. Briggs's exploits in
  deer-stalking, salmon-fishing, and grouse-shooting.</p>
<p>&quot;The late Duke of Athole asked him to Blair,
  and took him for a deer-drive. Previously to that
  there had been a good deal written in the papers
  against the Duke, in consequence of his Grace
  having stopped two University men from crossing
  the forest; and Leech made a drawing in <i>Punch</i> by
  no means complimentary of the Duke, who was
  represented turning back the tourists, exclaiming,
  'I am the regular Do-Dhu.' But you must turn to <i>Punch</i>, and you will find the illustration for yourself.
  I speak from memory as to the exact words; but I
  well recollect Leech, in his jocose way, asking me
  whether I thought he would be safe in the Duke's
  hands after that squib. I afterwards heard his
  Grace was delighted with it, and carried the woodcut
  about in his pocket to show to his friends.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>
<p>&quot;I have seen Leech make his first sketch (of
  which I have specimens), and trace them on to the
  block, scores of times. The first was rapid; but
  on the wood he was very deliberate, knowing how
  necessary clearness of execution is to the engraver.</p>
<p>&quot;The late Mr. Trelawney&mdash;the intimate friend
  of Byron and Shelley&mdash;speaking one day to me of
  his recollections, said that Shelley and Leech were
  the two men he had loved best, and that he cared
  to know me only because I was a great friend of
  the man he admired so much.&quot;</p>
<p>Here I may interpose to remind my readers that
  the figure of the sailor in Millais' superb picture of
  the North-West Passage was painted from Trelawney,
  who is supposed to say, &quot;It should be done, and
  England must do it.&quot; The man's head, painted
  with all Millais' power, is a most perfect likeness of
  Shelley's friend.</p>
<p>Millais goes on to tell us that &quot;some of the
  happiest days we spent together were at the
  Peacock Inn at Baslow, in Derbyshire, close to
  Chatsworth, where every kindness was shown to
  Leech by the Duke and Sir Joseph Paxton&mdash;shooting,
  fishing, and cricketing.&quot;</p>
<p>I again interpose to say that the portrait given as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> frontispiece to this volume was drawn on one of the
  &quot;happy days&quot; at the Peacock Inn at Baslow.</p>
<p>&quot;We played together in a match with a neighbouring
  village, and at a supper which he gave to
  the teams he sang 'King Death' with becoming
  gravity, and was much entertained by the local
  amorous ditties sung by the young farmers.&quot;</p>
<p>In further advice to Mr. Evans, Sir John says:</p>
<p>&quot;You cannot dwell too much on his tender
  anxiety for his wife and children, almost distressing
  at times to those about him.&quot;</p>
<p>The great painter continues:</p>
<p>&quot;I should tell you that he was always careful in
  his dress, and always went to the best houses for
  everything he purchased, probably from having
  early in life discovered the wisdom of such a course&mdash;see
  his satire of everything shoddy&mdash;but chiefly
  from inherent good taste. His choice was so quiet
  that one only <i>felt</i> he was perfectly attired. Leech
  was six feet high, slim, well but rather delicately
  made. Strangers felt when they were introduced
  to him that they were in the presence of a gentleman
  grave and courteous always, and a merry
  fellow when harmless fun was demanded. Like
  Landseer, he had the power of telling a story in
  the fewest words, and with astonishing effect upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> his hearers; but as a rule he was averse to taking
  the initiative in conversation. He would sit placidly
  smoking his cigar in an easy-chair, and only chime
  in to cap what was said by some voluble speaker,
  and then retire again into the full enjoyment of his
  weed and silence.&quot;</p>
<p>In his evidence before a Committee of the House
  of Commons which was formed to inquire into the
  constitution and working of the Royal Academy,
  with a view to certain changes in that body, Millais
  said that he thought Leech was deserving of full
  membership in the institution, for, indeed, said
  he:</p>
<p>&quot;Very few of us painters will leave behind us
  such good and valuable work as he has left&mdash;work
  which is in great part historical. His appreciation
  of the pathetic was as strong as his sense of the
  ridiculous, and you will never find a bit of false
  sentiment in anything he did.&quot;</p>
<p>Landseer is reported to have said&mdash;after expressing
  enthusiastic admiration of Leech's genius&mdash;that
  the worst thing he ever did deserved to be framed
  and placed before students as an example for their
  emulation and improvement. Sir John Millais
  concludes his remarks upon his friend&mdash;remarks for
  which I am sure my readers will be as grateful as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> am&mdash;by a few pathetic words heralding the sad and
  final scene:</p>
<p>&quot;He became so nervous latterly that he used to
  take my arm when we were walking together, jerking
  it perceptibly at any sudden noise, or at any
  vehicle passing rapidly near us; lingering an unnecessary
  time at the street crossings; and the
  morning he came from Thackeray's house, on
  coming downstairs after seeing his dead friend, he
  said, 'I also shall die suddenly.'</p>
<p>&quot;I arrived from a Continental tour,&quot; concludes
  Millais, &quot;the day of his death, and by arrangement
  went immediately to his house to dine with him.
  His wife told me he had been asking for me; but I
  did not think it wise to disturb him then. A little
  later I returned, ran upstairs to his bedside, and
  found him dead.&quot;</p>

<h3>MR. H. O. NETHERCOTE AND JOHN LEECH.</h3>
<p>For the following interesting paper my readers
  are indebted to Mr. Nethercote, of Moulton Grange,
  Northamptonshire, who sent it to my predecessor,
  Mr. Evans, amongst whose Leech material I found
  it. As Mr. Nethercote's anecdotes were intended
  for publication, I reproduce them without alteration
  or abbreviation. Mr. Nethercote and Leech were
  at Charterhouse together.</p>
<p>&quot;Leech,&quot; says his friend, &quot;was the most popular
  boy in the school, and the margins of his grammars
  were a delight to boyish eyes. After leaving
  Charterhouse I lost sight of him for many years;
  but through the medium of our common friend
  Reynolds, now Canon Hole, we came together
  again when he was living in Brunswick Square, and
  we frequently met at each other's houses. On one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> occasion, after telling me of his sufferings from
  street bands, he said:</p>
<p>&quot;'May I come to you with wife and family for a
  few days? I am dying of &quot;Dixie's Land.&quot;'</p>
<p>&quot;He came, and the very first day after dinner, on
  taking our evening stroll round the garden, our ears
  were greeted with the hateful tune! The village
  band had just mastered the homicidal air, and were
  inadvertently making themselves <i>particeps crimines</i> in the murder of my friend. I shall never forget
  his delightful smile as, when the doleful tune burst
  upon our ears, he said:</p>
<p>&quot;'Ah, well! &quot;Dixie's Land&quot; in Brunswick Square
  and &quot;Dixie's Land&quot; at Moulton Grange are two
  very different tunes; in the latter case a mile of
  atmosphere intervenes between it and me, and in
  the former I was in the very bowels of it.'</p>
<p>&quot;He was fond of going to see a meet with
  hounds, but he was no rider. He once asked me
  to sell him a horse I was riding, on the ground of
  its apparent quietness. I declined doing this because
  it was not right in its wind.</p>
<p>&quot;'All the better,' said he; 'it will not be able to
  run away far;' and he bought it.</p>
<p>&quot;He was fond of being here (at Moulton Grange),
  and used to enjoy taking quiet rides along the lanes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> and over the many-acred, well-gated grass fields, full
  of heavy Hertford and Devon cattle; and many a
  delightful chat have I had with him <i>in rebus
  Punchibus</i>, its contributors, artists, publishers,
  editors, etc. I am inclined to think that the man
  he liked best in the world was R. Hole, and then
  Thackeray and Millais; but of course I cannot say
  this with any certainty.&quot;</p>
<p>I stop Mr. Nethercote's narrative for a moment
  for Mrs. Leech to be heard; that lady assured
  Canon Hole&mdash;now Dean of Rochester&mdash;after Leech's
  death, that the two men whom her husband loved
  best in the world were himself and Millais.
  Thackeray was asked to name the man he loved
  above all others, and he named Leech; but on
  another occasion, when he was asked the same
  question by his daughter, as recorded in Fitzgerald's
  &quot;Memoirs,&quot; he said:</p>
<p>&quot;Why, Fitz, to be sure; and next to him Brookfield.&quot;</p>
<p>We will now listen again to Mr. Nethercote, who
  says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;By his desire I accompanied him one night to
    see 'Lord Dundreary,' and I shall never forget his
    dismay on seeing that neither the farce nor the
    acting had 'fetched' me. He could not understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span> my feeling that the whole thing was non-natural,
    and that no lord who ever lived was half so great a
    fool as Lord Dundreary.</p>
  <p>&quot;On one occasion he was staying at Moulton
    Grange on the eve of the great fight between
    Tom Sayers and Heenan. A lady of great beauty,
    one of the party, was enlarging overnight on the
    brutality of all prize-fights, and expressed a hope
    that this fight might be prevented. On hearing of
    Sayers' conduct in the fight, the lady could not
    help expressing her admiration of his bravery,
    whereon Leech made a charming sketch of his fair
    friend crowning Sayers with a laurel-wreath, and
    entitled it 'Beauty crowning Valour.'</p>
  <p>&quot;I need not say how greatly the sketch is valued
    by its possessors.</p>
  <p>&quot;Leech used to like hearing his work criticised
    by friendly amateurs, and seemed to take in and,
    as it were, masticate their comments.</p>
  <p>&quot;I remember once, over our after-dinner cigar,
    telling him that I considered he failed in portraying
    the periphery of a wheel&mdash;that he made it over-fluffy&mdash;and
    failed also in drawing a stake and bound
    fence.</p>
  <p>&quot;The latter he admitted, and begged me to find
    him a model to study. This I did, and an excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> 'stake and bound' appeared in the <i>Punch</i> of the
    following Wednesday.</p>
  <p>&quot;He stuck to his wheel, and doubtless he was
    right and I was wrong.</p>
  <p>&quot;The last letter I received from him was in reply
    to an invitation to come for a week's shooting. I
    knew that he had been ill, and hoped it might do
    him good. His answer was:</p>
  <p>&quot;'Shoot, my dear Nethercote; I couldn't walk
    round a turnip.'</p>
  <p>&quot;When that was written the end was not far off.
    The news reached me as I left home to hunt, and
    heavy indeed was my heart all that day, and for
    many a succeeding one, and still is when I think of
    him, the warmest-hearted, most generous, gracious,
    kindly, hospitable, endearing friend that man ever
    had.</p>
  <p>&quot;Such are some of the recollections of my dear
    friend, written off in a hurry. If they prove of
    any use to you, you are most welcome to them.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mr. Ashby Sterry.</span></h3>
<p>The name which heads the few words below is
  one that is very familiar as the writer of many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span> charming verses; and it is no wonder that Mr.
  Evans, on discovering the sonnet addressed to Miss
  Rosie Leech, should have mistaken the source of
  its inspiration, the more readily, as Miss Leech was
  christened Ada Rose.</p>
<p>In the belief that my readers will be glad to have
  the verses, and Mr. Ashby Sterry's account of their
  production, I add them to Mr. Sterry's sympathetic
  appreciation of Leech.</p>
<p>&quot;For as long as I can remember, I have had the
  most profound admiration for the genius of John
  Leech,&quot; says Mr. Sterry; &quot;and he gave me as
  much delight in my childhood as he subsequently
  did when I became a man. I am grieved to say
  that I hardly knew him at all; it was many years
  after his death that I became connected with <i>Punch</i>.
  I should be most happy for you to quote the lines
  to Miss Rosie Leech; they, however, do not refer
  to John Leech's daughter. Several girls that I
  knew some years ago reminded me forcibly of the
  works of various artists. I sketched their portraits
  in sonnets, and added their Christian name to the
  surname of the master they represented.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosie was emphatically a &quot;Leech girl&quot; in all
  respects, and one that he would have gloried in
  drawing.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mr. H. Cholmondeley Pennell and Leech.</span></h3>
<h3>&quot;PUCK ON PEGASUS.&quot;</h3>
<p>Mr. C. Pennell (<i>loquitur</i>): &quot;My acquaintance
  began with his making some illustrations for my
  book 'Puck on Pegasus.' I found him liberal to
  generosity in all his professional dealings with me.
  Indeed, I have since ascertained that, seeing I was
  a d&eacute;butant in literature, he only let me pay him
  about half his usual price&mdash;a generosity in which he
  was equalled by my friend Mr. John Tenniel. The
  charming drawings of these two inimitable artists on
  wood were, I have not the slightest doubt, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span> principal cause of the success of the verses to which
  they were so unequally mated.</p>
<p>&quot;The Athen&aelig;um, I recollect, whilst using the
  scalping-knife freely on the letterpress, observed
  that 'the illustrations were of Leech's loveliest.'
  Naturally, I have always felt towards Leech and
  Tenniel the gratitude which a young author owes to
  men who, already famous themselves, so frankly
  and generously first lent him a helping hand.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Mr. Tenniel and Mr. Leech were at the
  time I speak of great friends, and I remember their
  once asking me to go down somewhere to hunt
  with them&mdash;an invitation which I have since regretted
  not being able to accept. Leech was an
  enthusiast about hunting, and hence his admirable
  and accurate delineations of horses and hunting
  scenes.</p>
<p>&quot;He was a decidedly handsome man; tall,
  square, and well built, and in manners delightfully
  genial and frank. I was young when I knew him,
  and had not had much experience of the world; but
  I have often thought since that he was one of the
  most fascinating men it has ever been my good
  fortune to meet.</p>
<p>&quot;Out of the artists whose pencils graced the
  pages of 'Puck on Pegasus,' not only those I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> mentioned, but also Sir John Millais and Sir No&euml;l
  Paton, are, as everyone knows, striking instances of
  exceptional&mdash;well, what shall I call it, to spare their
  blushes?&mdash;say 'good looks.' Since I last met the
  'Queen's Limner for Scotland,' his hair has become
  gray, but, notwithstanding, as I told Lady Paton a
  few weeks ago, her husband is still the handsomest
  man in North Britain.</p>
<p>&quot;The only little special circumstance I can recall
  of Leech's 'individualism,' so to speak, is the fondness
  he had for sitting half on the table&mdash;one leg
  resting on the ground, and one dangling&mdash;the attitude
  in which he is represented in the photograph I
  have of him.&quot;</p>
<p>As the foregoing&mdash;found amongst Mr. Evans'
  Leech material&mdash;was evidently intended for publication,
  I make no scruple in presenting it to my
  readers. Without presuming to pose as a literary
  critic, I venture to differ from the author of &quot;Puck
  on Pegasus&quot; where he relegates his rhymes so far to
  the limbo of poetical failures as to claim for their
  chief merit that of having been the cause of some
  most admirable illustrations. Mr. Cholmondeley
  Pennell was unusually fortunate in all his illustrators;
  but surely such brilliantly clever youthful efforts
  as &quot;Puck on Pegasus&quot; displayed well deserved their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> good fortune. I confess I was disappointed in finding
  two drawings only which, from internal evidence,
  I can attribute to Leech; these, and, indeed, most
  of the others, strange to say, are unsigned.</p>
<p>Readers of Longfellow will, I think, agree with
  me that the &quot;Song of In-the-Water&quot; is an admirable
  imitation of the manner of the American
  poet's &quot;Hiawatha,&quot; without the caricature, not
  to say vulgarity, which so often disfigures those
  attempts.</p>
<p>The &quot;Song of In-the-Water&quot; is short, and
  I am tempted to treat my readers to the whole
  of it.</p>
<p>I also note the delightful little initial letter W,
  pictorially rendered, evidently by Doyle:</p>

</div>
<p>We may look, and look in vain, through the long
  list of Leech's delightful creations for anything more
  lovely, more exquisitely dainty, than this floating
  damsel, with grace and charm in every line of her.
  I am sure my readers will join me in gratitude to
  Mr. Pennell for having given occasion for a picture
  that is &quot;a joy for ever.&quot;</p>
<p>Leech's remaining drawing illustrates a poem
  entitled &quot;Rejected Addresses,&quot; not in any way, I
  think, intended as a parody of any of the celebrated
  &quot;Rejected Addresses&quot; of Messrs. Smith&mdash;addresses,
  it will be remembered, that were written
  in the manner of various poets who flourished early
  in this century. Mr. Pennell deals with a certain
  Alderman, a Sir Toby, who was</p>
<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&quot;An Alderman of the very first degree,<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">But neither wife nor son had he:<br />
    </span> <span class="i5">He had a daughter fair&mdash;<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">And often said her father, 'Cis,<br />
    </span> <span class="i1">You shall be dubbed &quot;my Lady,&quot; Miss,<br />
    </span> <span class="i5">When I am dubbed Lord Mayor.'&quot;<br />
    </span> </div>
</div>
<p>&quot;Sir Gobble Grist&quot; was the aged swain of
  parental choice, but, as is not uncommon in such
  cases, the choice was not favoured by one of the
  parties concerned in it. The Alderman was, however,
  peremptory, for he says to the pretty Cis:</p>

<p>Surely the poet has no occasion to blush for these
  verses, or to think that they needed Leech's aid to
  preserve them. To me they seem admirable of
  their kind, and well worthy of affording employment
  for Leech's inimitable pencil; and how perfectly has
  he realized for us the happy pair! Let us hope that
  pretty Cis has made a prudent choice in the handsome
  Volunteer, whose uneasy glance conveys a fear
  that the journey 'due North' may still be interrupted.
  To those who desire to read sprightly verse, and
  to see the verse illustrated with very uncommon
  perfection by such artists as Doyle, Millais, Tenniel,
  Sir No&euml;l Paton, and others, I heartily commend
  &quot;Puck on Pegasus.&quot;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the 25th of October, 1864, I dined
  at the house of Mr. Hills, in Queen Ann Street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span> The party consisted of several gentlemen, most of
  whose names I forget. I think Landseer and
  Millais were amongst the guests. I am sure Leech
  was, for I sat next to him. I cannot say I noticed
  much difference in his appearance; he was perhaps
  even quieter than usual, and when he joined in
  general conversation I fancied I noticed a slight
  change in his deep voice, which seemed to me to
  have a kind of far-away sound in it, more noticeable
  still when he spoke to me. I heard he had not been
  well, and, in reply to my inquiry, he said he should
  be well enough if he could get away from the horrible
  noises that never seemed to cease in his neighbourhood.
  Back and front of his house, he said, noises
  of all kinds were incessant; his servant's time was
  taken up in sending away street musicians; the cries
  of the hawkers were awful, work was impossible to
  him except under agonizing conditions&mdash;a butcher's
  cart passed and repassed his house repeatedly with
  a dog in it that barked continually. He then mentioned
  other nuisances, and concluded his grievances
  with a sentence which I can never forget. &quot;Rather,
  Frith,&quot; he said, &quot;than continue to be tormented in
  this way, I would prefer to go to the grave where
  there is no noise.&quot; Before that day week his desire
  was accomplished, his ever-to-be-honoured grave had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span> received him, and he was deaf to all noises for evermore.</p>
<p>Leech's doctors had warned him against excitement
  of any kind; he was forbidden to ride on
  horseback or to walk rapidly; and he was told that,
  if he would cease to work, and dismiss all anxiety
  from his mind, they had good hope of his recovery.
  Cease to work and dismiss anxiety! What vain
  words to a man who was consumed by the desire to
  raise money, which nothing but work would bring!
  And for whom were these dying energies put forth?
  Clearly not for himself or &quot;his own household.&quot;</p>
<p>The day before his death Leech went to see
  Dr. Quain, who again prescribed absolute rest as
  his only chance. And how did the poor fellow
  follow this advice? He went home and wrote to
  the <i>Punch</i> office, saying that a messenger might be
  sent for a drawing in progress, which &quot;he would
  finish if he could.&quot; Strange to say, the fancy was
  as bright and the imagination as powerful as ever,
  and, for the moment, the hand itself had lost none of
  its cunning; but the physical strength failed utterly,
  and the pencil fell from that wonderful hand for ever.
  The messenger came, and was sent empty away.</p>
<p>On the day of his death&mdash;having spent the rest
  of the previous day, after his failure to complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span> the <i>Punch</i> drawing, in bed&mdash;he begged to be allowed
  to draw. &quot;It would amuse me,&quot; he said. A
  medical friend who was present gave a reluctant
  permission, and seeing no immediate appearance
  of danger, the doctor left him to his amusement.
  &quot;Instead, however, of beginning at once,&quot; says
  Miss Leech, &quot;he threw himself upon a couch in the
  room, and after a little while he was persuaded to
  go to bed and keep himself perfectly quiet. This
  he did, but scarcely had he composed himself for
  sleep than he suddenly started up and, calling to his
  father and sister, fell back and expired in their arms
  without a sigh.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus, on the 29th of October, 1864, died John
  Leech, done to death by overwork in his anxiety for
  others, who, let us hope, were worthy of the sacrifice.
  It is not too much to say that the death of this
  inimitable artist was a sorrow to all English-speaking
  people, and no less to many foreign peoples, who&mdash;&quot;as
  one touch of nature makes the whole world
  kin&quot;&mdash;fully relished the beauty, truth, and humour
  of all Leech's work. Of this we have ample proof
  in the elaborately appreciative remarks of French
  and German writers. Among the former, M. Ernest
  Chesnau, in the <i>Gazette des Beaux Arts</i> of June,
  1875, has an exhaustive article on Leech and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span> works&mdash;too long for reproduction here. Of the
  loving sympathy felt by his German brethren, the
  following tribute from the German <i>Punch</i>&mdash;the <i>Kladderadatsch</i>&mdash;offers ample evidence. It is entitled
  &quot;A Cypress Branch for the Tomb of John
  Leech.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Poor John! Thy German brethren, too, stand
  in the shape of a weeping willow at thy grave, for
  our locks are turned to mourning branches that
  droop down over thy simple cross. Ungrudgingly
  we behold thy glory, thy 'like nature' which stirred
  up the foul carp-pond of life. We remember thy
  fox-hunting and angling gentlemen, thy ladies, the
  pretty ones and the declining, thy blue stockings,
  thy gentlemen, thy volunteers, thy sportsmen, thy
  Flunkeiana, and thy immortal Mr. Briggs, this pearl
  of English <i>bonhommie</i>. Mr. Punch, too, whose
  greatest ornament thou wert, sits mourning on thy
  tomb. He has cast off his merry Punchinello costume,
  and is nothing but a sorrowing old man. Farewell,
  merry John, thou boy of endless good-humour.</p>
<p>&quot;We erect this little monument in thy own spirit,
  with an eye that laughs through tears, for after thou
  hadst conquered the first bitter pangs of death, thou
  must surely at thy last moment have smiled at
  leaving this miserable world.&quot;</p>

<p>The English journals vied with each other in
  expressions of sorrow for this irreparable loss. The
  death of Garrick, said Dr. Johnson, &quot;eclipsed the
  gaiety of nations.&quot; How much more truly this may be
  said of the premature death of Leech! Never was
  man so loved and honoured by his personal friends,
  never was a man's death more sincerely mourned than
  that of &quot;dear, kind John Leech&quot; by those who had
  the delightful privilege of knowing intimately all the
  endearing qualities of his heart and mind. See
  what that great man, who was so soon to follow him
  to the grave, says, and think what the simple words
  imply! Says Dickens, in a letter to Forster written
  a few days after Leech's death, &quot;I have not done
  my number ('Our Mutual Friend'). This death of
  poor Leech has put me out woefully.&quot;</p>
<p>It was predicted that Leech's death would be death
  to <i>Punch</i>. How false and foolish that prophecy was,
  none knew so well as Leech himself; but while
  admitting to the full the great talent of the present <i>Punch</i> staff of artists, it cannot be denied that
  Leech's place is vacant, and I assume the prophetic
  mantle and proclaim (I hope mistakenly) that it will
  never be filled. It should always be borne in mind
  that though it is impossible to exaggerate the benefit
  that <i>Punch</i> derived from Leech's pencil, the artist is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span> also deeply indebted to <i>Punch</i> for the exceptional
  opportunities the peculiar character of the paper
  offered for the display of his powers. The fact is,
  the paper and the illustrations were exactly suited
  to each other, and always worked harmoniously
  together.</p>
<p>That Leech's death would be keenly felt by all
  connected with <i>Punch</i> goes without saying, and if
  tears are evidences of grief, those that fell from the
  eyes of the whole of the staff as they stood round
  Leech's grave gave full assurance of their sorrow.</p>
<p>On the 3rd of November, by a notice in the daily
  papers, the public were informed that the funeral of
  John Leech would take place at Kensal Green on
  the following day. At two o'clock on the afternoon
  of the 4th, great crowds of people lined the ways
  from the chapel to the grave, which was already
  surrounded by the friends and acquaintances of the
  dead. The pall-bearers were Mark Lemon, Shirley
  Brooks, Tom Taylor, J. E. Millais, R.A., Horace
  Mayhew, M. Evans (Bradbury and Evans, of <i>Punch</i>),
  John Tenniel, F. C. Burnand, Samuel Lucas, and
  Henry Silver (all members of the staff or contributors
  to <i>Punch</i>). These were followed by John Leech, the
  artist's father; Dr. Quain, poor Leech's unwearied
  attendant in his illness; Charles Keene, George Du<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span> Maurier, and others, all more or less associated with
  Leech in their relation to <i>Punch</i>. In attendance
  were Charles Dickens, W. H. Russell, Perceval
  Leigh, Edmund Yates, Charles F. Adams, German
  Reed, H. K. Browne ('Phiz'), Thomas Landseer,
  A.R.A., George Cruikshank, Godfrey Turner,
  Creswick (the tragedian), Marcus Stone, J. Phillip,
  R.A., W. P. Frith, R.A., and many others. The
  red coats of two soldiers made bright spots amongst
  the sombre crowd. The service for the dead was
  read by the Rev. S. R. Hole, now Dean of Rochester,
  whose warm friendship for Leech distressingly affected
  him in his delivery of the solemn passages in the
  burial service. The last words had scarcely ceased
  when we crowded together, and without a dry eye
  amongst us, as we took our farewell look into the
  resting-place of the man we loved so well. One
  tomb only divides the graves of Thackeray and
  Leech. Of both these men it may be justly said
  that, like Saul and Jonathan of old, &quot;they were
  beautiful in their lives,&quot; and but a short time and a
  small space divide them in their deaths.</p>
<p>Leech's wife and children soon followed him to
  the grave; and though, to the surprise and regret
  of all who knew of the immense mass of work
  that he produced, he was unable to leave even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span> a moderate fortune behind him, it is satisfactory
  to know that his family did not suffer. Anything
  approaching privation was warded off by means
  which it is not necessary to particularize.</p>
<p>The whole world is the inheritor under the will
  of Leech; and what a legacy he has bequeathed!
  Posterity will be able to study us in our habits as we
  lived, in our pleasures and our pains, in our follies
  and eccentricities, in our sports and amusements&mdash;in
  short, in every condition of life, high and low. A
  type, or types, of every class, from the very poor to
  the very rich, from the beggar to the King, spring
  perfect from Leech's pencil. He revels in beauty;
  tenderness and manly strength combine in his works,
  as they did in himself, a love of what is good and pure,
  and a hatred of the ignoble and the base is shown
  in all he drew, and in every act of his private life.
  My endeavour in these pages has been to convey
  to those to whom Leech will be but a name, as clear
  an idea as lay in my power of the &quot;life and character&quot;
  of the author of the matchless works which will be a
  delight for all time. Death only sanctifies the loving
  memory in which Leech will be held by those who
  knew him. The kindly and intelligent of future
  generations will, I hope and believe, not only appreciate
  the humour and character, the fun and frolic, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> Leech's drawings, but discover also the delightful
  nature of their producer in many a tender touch, in
  many a good-natured rendering of matter that was
  susceptible in other hands of severe or vulgar treatment;
  and if I can create for him something of the
  affectionate regard in the future that is universally
  felt for him in the present, my object in writing this
  imperfect memoir will be attained.</p>
